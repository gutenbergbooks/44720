<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I" name="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br /><br />
PACKING AND THE OUTFIT</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">Ordinarily</span> the verb <i>to pack</i> means
to stow articles snugly into receptacles,
but in the parlance of the trail it often
means to carry or transport the articles from
place to place. The <i>pack</i> in the language of
the trail is the load a man or horse carries.</p>

<p>Likewise, a <i>portage</i> on a canoe route is a
break between navigable waters, over which
canoe and outfit must be carried; or the word
may be used as a verb, and one may say, "I
will portage the canoe," meaning "I will carry
the canoe." In the course of the following
pages these terms will doubtless all be used in
their various significations.</p>

<p>Save for the few who are able to employ a
retinue of professional guides and packers to
attend to the details of transportation, the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10" name="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
chief problem that confronts the wilderness
traveler is that of how to reduce the weight
of his outfit to the minimum with the least
possible sacrifice of comfort. It is only the
veriest tenderfoot that deliberately endures
hardships or discomforts where hardships and
discomforts are unnecessary. Experienced
wilderness travelers always make themselves
as comfortable as conditions will permit, and
there is no reason why one who hits the trail
for sport, recreation or health should do otherwise.</p>

<p>In a description, then, of the methods of
packing and transporting outfits the tenderfoot
and even the man whose feet are becoming calloused
may welcome some hints as to the selection
of compact, light, but, at the same time, efficient
outfits. These hints on outfitting, therefore,
I shall give, leaving out of consideration
the details of camp making, camp cookery and
those phases of woodcraft that have no direct
bearing upon the prime question of packing and
transportation on the trail.</p>

<p>Let us classify the various methods of wilderness
travel under the following heads: 1.
By Canoe; 2. With Saddle and Pack Animals;
3. Afoot in Summer; 4. On Snowshoes; 5.
With Dogs and Sledge. Taking these in order,
and giving our attention first to canoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11" name="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
travel, it will be found convenient further to
subdivide this branch of the subject and discuss
in order: (a) The Canoe and its Equipment;
(b) Camp Equipment for a Canoe
Trip; (c) Personal Equipment; (d) Food;
(e) The Portage.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II" name="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br /><br />
    THE CANOE AND ITS EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">A sixteen-foot</span> canoe with a width
of at least 33 inches and a depth of at
least 12 inches will accommodate two
men, an adequate camping outfit and a full ten
weeks' provisions very nicely, and at the same
time not lie too deep in the water. A fifteen-foot
canoe, unless it has a beam of at least 35
inches and a depth of 12 inches or more, is
unsuitable. Three men with their outfit and
provisions will require an eighteen-foot canoe
with a width of 35 inches or more and a depth
of no less than 13 inches, or a seventeen-foot
canoe with a width of 37 inches and 13 inches
deep. The latter size is lighter by from ten
to fifteen pounds than the former, while the
displacement is about equal.</p>

<p>The best all-around canoe for cruising and
hard usage is the canvas-covered cedar canoe.
Both ribs and planking should be of cedar, and
only full length planks should enter into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
construction. Where short planking is used
the canoe will sooner or later become hogged&mdash;that
is, the ends will sag downward from the
middle.</p>

<p>In Canada the "Peterborough" canoe is
more largely used than the canvas-covered.
These are to be had in both basswood and
cedar. Cedar is brittle, while basswood is
tough, but the latter absorbs water more readily
than the former and in time will become
more or less waterlogged.</p>

<p>Cruising canoes should be supplied with a
middle thwart for convenient portaging. Any
canoe larger than sixteen feet should have
three thwarts. To lighten weight on the portage,
and provide more room for storing outfit,
it is advisable to remove the cane seats with
which canvas canoes are usually provided.
This can be readily done by unscrewing the
nuts beneath the gunwale which hold the seats
in position.</p>

<p>Good strong paddles&mdash;sufficiently strong to
withstand the heavy strain to which cruising
paddles are put&mdash;should be selected. On the
portage they must bear the full weight of the
canoe; they will frequently be utilized in poling
up stream against stiff currents; and in running
rapids they will be subjected to rough
usage. On extended cruises it is advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
carry one spare paddle to take the place of
one that may be rendered useless.</p>

<p>Experienced canoemen pole up minor rapids.
Poles for this purpose can usually be cut at the
point where they are needed, but pole "shoes"&mdash;that
is, spikes fitted with ferrules&mdash;to fit on
the ends of poles are a necessary adjunct to
the outfit where poling is to be done. Without
shoes to hold the pole firmly on the bottom
of the stream the pole may slip and pitch
the canoeman overboard. The ferrules should
be punctured with at least two nail holes, by
which they may be secured to the poles, and
a few nails should be carried for this purpose.</p>

<p>A hundred feet or so of half-inch rope
should also be provided, to be used as a tracking
line and the various other uses for which
rope may be required.</p>

CAMP EQUIPMENT FOR A CANOE TRIP</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">Personal</span> likes and prejudices have
much to do with the form of tent chosen.
My own preference is for either the "A"
or wedge tent, with the Hudson's Bay model as
second choice, for general utility. Either of
these is particularly adapted also to winter
travel where the tent must often be pitched
upon the snow. If, however, the tent is only
to be used in summer, and particularly in canoe
travel where a light, easily erected model is
desired, the Frazer tent is both ideal for comfort
and is an exceedingly light weight model
for portaging.</p>

<p>Duck or drill tents are altogether too heavy
and quite out of date. They soak water and
are an abomination on the portage. The best
tent is one of balloon silk, <i>tanalite</i>, or of extra
light green waterproofed tent cloth. The balloon
silk tent is very slightly heavier than
either of the others, but is exceedingly durable.
For instance, a <span class="dimension">7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> &times; 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> foot "A" tent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16" name="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
either tanalite or extra light green waterproof
tent cloth, fitted with sod cloth, complete,
weighs eight pounds, while a similar tent of
waterproof balloon silk weighs nine pounds.
A Hudson's Bay model, <span class="dimension">6 &times; 9</span> feet, weighs respectively
seven and seven and one-half pounds.</p>

<p>These three cloths are not only waterproof
and practically rot proof, but do not soak
water, which is a feature for consideration
where much portaging is to be done and camp
is moved almost daily.</p>

<p>Some dealers recommend that customers
going into a fly or mosquito country have
the tent door fitted with bobbinet. The idea
is good, but cheese cloth is much cheaper and
incomparably better than bobbinet.</p>

<p>The cheese-cloth door should be made rather
full, and divided at the center from tent peak
to ground, with numerous tie strings to bring
the edges tight together when in use, and other
strings or tapes on either side, where it is attached
to the tent, to reef or roll and tie it back
out of the way when not needed.</p>

<p>When purchasing a light-weight tent, see
that the dealer supplies a bag of proper size
in which to pack it.</p>

<p>A pack cloth <span class="dimension">6 &times; 7</span> feet in size, of brown
waterproof canvas weighing about 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds,
makes an excellent covering for the tent floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
at night. On the portage blankets and odds
and ends will be packed and carried on it. If
one end and the two sides of the pack cloth
are fitted with snap buttons it may be converted
into a snug sleeping bag with a pair of blankets
folded lengthwise, the bottom and sides
of the blanket secured with blanket safety pins
as a lining for the bag.</p>

<p>My standby for summer camping is a fine
all-wool gray blanket <span class="dimension">72 &times; 78</span> inches in size
and weighing 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds. This I have found
sufficient even in frosty autumn weather&mdash;always,
in fact, until the weather grows cold
enough to freeze streams and close them to
canoe navigation. Used as a lining for the
improvised pack cloth sleeping bag, this blanket
is quite bedding enough and makes an exceedingly
comfortable bed, too.</p>

<p>A three-quarter axe with a 24- or 28-inch
handle makes a mighty good camp axe. A
full axe is heavy and inconvenient to portage
and the lighter axe will serve every purpose in
any country at any time. Personally I favor
the Hudson's Bay axe. This may be had fitted
either with a 24-inch or 18-inch handle. In
the two-party outfit which we are discussing
there should be two axes, one of which may
be fitted with the shorter handle, but the other
should have at least a 24- and preferably a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18" name="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
28-inch handle. Every axe should have a
leather sheath or scabbard for convenient packing.
The so-called pocket axes are too small
to be of practical use. The camper does not
wish to miss the luxury of the big evening
camp-fire, and he can never provide for it with
a small hatchet or toy pocket axe.</p>

<p>Cooking utensils of aluminum alloy are the
lightest and best for the trail. Tin and iron
will rust, enamel ware will chip, and unalloyed
aluminum is too soft and bends out of shape.
The best sporting goods dealers carry complete
outfits of aluminum alloy. I have used them
in the frigid North and in the tropics, in canoe,
sledging, tramping and horseback journeys,
and can recommend them unequivocally, save
perhaps the frying pan.</p>

<p>The two-man cooking and dining outfit
should contain the following utensils:</p>

<ul class="list">
    <li>1 Pot with cover <span class="dimension">7 &times; 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, capacity three quarts.</li>
    <li>1 Coffee pot <span class="dimension">6 &times; 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inches, capacity two quarts.</li>
    <li>1 Steel frying pan <span class="dimension">9<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> &times; 2</span> inches, with folding handle.</li>
    <li>1 Pan <span class="dimension">9 &times; 3</span> inches, with folding handle, for mixing- and dish-pan.</li>
    <li>2 Plates 8<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches diameter.</li>
    <li>2 Cups.</li>
    <li>2 Aluminum alloy forks.</li>
    <li>2 Dessert spoons.</li>
    <li>1 Large cooking spoon.</li>
    <li>1 Dish mop.</li>
    <li>2 Dish towels.</li>
</ul>

<p>The regular aluminum alloy cup is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19" name="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
small for practical camp use. There is an
aluminum bowl, however, holding one pint, but
without a handle. This is about the right size
for a practical cup, and I have a handle riveted
on it and use it as a cup. The top only of the
handle should be attached, that the cups may
set one inside the other. The heat conducting
quality of aluminum makes it a question
whether or not enamel cups are not preferable.</p>

<p>To pack the outfit snugly, set the mixing pan
into the frying pan, the handles of both pans
folded, place the plates, one on top of the
other, in the mixing pan, the cooking pot on
top of these, and the coffee pot inside the cooking
pot. The cups will fit in the coffee pot.
The weight of this outfit complete is 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
pounds.</p>

<p>A waterproof canvas bag of proper size
should be provided in which to pack the utensils.
Forks and spoons, wrapped in a dish
towel, will fit nicely in the canvas bag alongside
the pots.</p>

<p><i>Waterproof</i> canvas is suggested for the bag,
not to protect the utensils but because anything
but waterproofed material will absorb
moisture and become watersoaked in rainy
weather, adding materially to the weight of
the outfit.</p>

<p>One of the handiest aids to baking is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20" name="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
aluminum reflecting baker. An aluminum
baker <span class="dimension">16 &times; 18</span> inches when open, folds to a
package <span class="dimension">12 &times; 18</span> inches and about two inches
thick, and fitted into a waterproof canvas case
weighs, case and all, about four pounds.</p>

<p>Broilers, fire irons, fire blowers or inspirators,
as they are sometimes called, and many
other things that are convenient enough but
quite unnecessary, should never burden the outfit.
Even though the weight of some of them
may be insignificant, each additional claptrap
makes one more thing to look after. There
are a thousand and one claptraps, indeed, that
outfitters offer, but which do not possess sufficient
advantage to pay for the care and labor
of transportation, and my advice is, leave them
out, one and all.</p>

<p>Outfitters supply small packing bags of
proper size to fit, one on top of another, into
larger waterproof canvas bags. These small
bags are made preferably of balloon silk. By
using them the whole outfit may be snugly and
safely packed for the portage.</p>

<p>In one of these small bags keep the general
supply of matches, though each canoeist should
carry a separate supply for emergency in his
individual kit.</p>

<p>In like manner two or three cakes of soap
should be packed in another small bag. Float<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21" name="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ing
soap is less likely to be lost than soap that
sinks.</p>

<p>A dozen candles will be quite enough.
These if packed in a tin box of proper size
will not be broken.</p>

<p>Repair kits should be provided. A file for
sharpening axes and a whetstone for general
use are of the first importance. Include also
a pair of pincers, a ball of stout twine and a
few feet of copper wire. A tool haft or handle
with a variety of small tools inside is convenient.
Either a stick of canoe cement, a
small supply of marine glue, or a canoe repair
outfit such as canoe manufacturers put up and
which contain canvas, white lead, copper tacks,
calor and varnish will be found a valuable adjunct
to the outfit should the canoe become
damaged. This tool and repair equipment
should be packed in a strong canvas bag small
enough to drop into the larger nine-inch waterproof
bag.</p>

<p>A small leather medicine case with vials
containing, in tabloid form, a cathartic, an
astringent (lead and opium pills are good)
and bichloride of mercury, suffices for the
drug supply. Surgical necessities are: Some
antiseptic bandages, a package of linen gauze,
a spool of adhesive plaster and one-eighth
pound of absorbent cotton, wrapped in oiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
silk. In addition most campers find it convenient
to have in their personal outfit a pair
of small scissors. These are absolutely necessary
if one is to put on a bandage properly.
The regular surgical scissors, the two blades of
which hook together at the center, are the
most convenient sort, both to use and to carry,
and have the keenest edge.</p>

<p>A pair of tweezers takes up but little room
and is useful for extracting splinters or for
holding a wad of absorbent cotton in swabbing
out a wound, as cotton will, of course, become
septic if held in the fingers.</p>

<p>A small scalpel is better than the knife blade
for opening up an infection, as it is more convenient
to handle and will make a deep short
incision when desired. These will all be
packed in one of the small balloon silk bags.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV" name="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />
PERSONAL EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">Each</span> canoeist should have a personal
kit or duffle bag of waterproof canvas.
These may be purchased from outfitters
and are usually 36 inches deep and of 12, 15,
18 or 21 inches diameter. The 12-inch bag,
however, is amply large to accommodate all
one needs in the way of clothing and other personal
gear. This, as well as every other
waterproof canvas packing bag mentioned, excepting
the cooking kit bag, should be supplied
with a handle on the bottom and one on the
side. These bags not only keep the contents
dry, but, as previously stated, do not absorb
moisture to add to the weight, a very essential
feature where every unnecessary pound
must be eliminated. I was once capsized in a
rapid and my duffle bag lay half a day in the
water before it was recovered. The contents
were perfectly dry.</p>

<p>One suit of medium weight woolen underclothing
in addition to the suit worn is ample<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24" name="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
for a short trip. Four extra pairs of thick
woolen socks should be provided&mdash;the home-knit
kind. An excellent material for trousers
to be worn on the trail is moleskin, though for
midsummer wear a good quality khaki is first
rate. Moleskin, however, will withstand the
hardest usage and to my mind is superior to
khaki or any other material where wading is
necessary and on cold or rainy days, as it is
very nearly windproof. A good leather belt
should be worn, even though suspenders support
the trousers.</p>

<p>The outer shirt should be of light weight
gray or brown flannel and provided with pockets.
A blue flannel shirt of the best quality
is all right. The cheaper qualities of blue
crock, and this feature makes them objectionable.
If the outer shirt is too heavy it will be
found cumbersome under the exertion of the
portage.</p>

<p>A large, roomy Pontiac shirt to slip over the
outer shirt and use as a sweater is much preferable
to a sweater on the trail. It is windproof
and warm. Do not take a coat&mdash;the
Pontiac shirt will be both coat and sweater.
A coat is always in the way on a canoe trip
and makes the pack that much heavier.</p>

<p>A pair of low leather or canvas wading
shoes for river work and larrigans or shoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25" name="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
pacs for ordinary wear, large enough to admit
two pairs of woolen socks, are best suited to
canoeing. Heavy, hobnailed mountaineer
shoes or boots are not in place here.</p>

<p>Heavy German socks, supplied with garter
and clasp to hold them in position, are better
than canvas leggings, and protect the legs from
chill at times when wading is necessary in icy
waters.</p>

<p>Any kind of an old slouch hat is suitable.</p>

<p>Some canoeists take with them a suit of
featherweight oilskin. Personally I have
never worn rainproof garments when canoeing.
Once I carried a so-called waterproof
coat, but it was not waterproof. It leaked
water like a sieve, and was no protection even
from the gentlest shower. I am inclined, however,
to favor featherweight oilskins, though
not while portaging&mdash;they would be found too
warm&mdash;but when paddling in rainy weather,
or to wear on rainy days about camp.</p>

<p>If the trip is to extend into a black fly or
mosquito region, protection against the insects
should be provided. A head net of black bobbinet
that will set down upon the shoulders,
with strings to tie under the arms, is about the
best arrangement for the head. Old loose kid
gloves, with the fingers cut off, and farmers'
satin elbow sleeves to fit under the wrist bands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26" name="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the outer shirt will protect the wrists and
hands. The armlets should be well and tightly
sewn upon the gloves, for black flies are not
content to attack where they alight, and will
explore for the slightest opening and discover
some undefended spot. They are, too, a hundred
times more vicious than mosquitoes.</p>

<p>There are many receipts for fly dope, but in
a half hour after application perspiration will
eliminate the virtue of most mixtures and a
renewed application must be made. Nessmuk's
receipt is perhaps as good as any, and
the formula is as follows:</p>

<table summary="Ingredients" class="list">
<tr><td>Oil of pine tar</td><td>3 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Castor oil</td><td>2 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oil of pennyroyal</td><td>1 part</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If when you were a child your father held
your nose as an inducement for you to open
your mouth while your mother poured castor
oil down your throat, the odor of the castor
oil rising above the odors of the other ingredients
will revive sad memories. Indeed it is
claimed for this mixture that the dead will
rise and flee from its compounded odor as they
would flee from eternal torment. It certainly
should ward off such little creatures as black
flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Another effective mixture is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<table summary="Ingredients" class="list">
<tr><td>Oil of tar</td><td>3 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sweet oil</td><td>3 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oil of pennyroyal</td><td>1 part</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carbolic acid</td><td>3 per cent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>An Indian advised me once to carry a fat
salt pork rind in my pocket, and now and again
rub the greasy side upon face and hands. I
tried it and found it nearly as good as the
dopes.</p>

<p>Unless one penetrates, however, far north
In Canada during black fly season these extraordinary
precautions will scarcely be necessary.
There Is nowhere In the United States
a region where black flies are really very bad
(though perhaps I am drawing invidious comparisons
in making the statement), and even
in interior Newfoundland they are, compared
with the farther north, tame and rather inoffensive
though always troublesome.</p>

<p>The choice of fishing tackle, guns and arms
depends largely upon personal taste. Steel
rods of the best quality will serve better than
split bamboo on an extended trip where one,
continuously on the portage trail, is often unable
to properly dry the tackle. The steady
soaking of a split bamboo rod for a week is
likely to loosen the sections and injure a fine
rod. A waterproof canvas or pantasote case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
is the right sort for the rod&mdash;leather cases are
unpractical on a cruising trip.</p>

<p>Leather gun cases, too, under like circumstances
will become watersoaked, and under
any circumstances they are unnecessarily
heavy. Use canvas cases therefore in consideration
for your back. They are light and in
a season of rain immeasurably better than
leather.</p>

<p>Economize, also, on ammunition. Do your
target practice before you hit the trail. A
hunter that cannot get his limit of big game
with twenty rifle cartridges is an unsafe individual
to turn loose in the woods.</p>

<p>For spruce grouse, ptarmigan and other
small game a ten-inch barrel, 22-caliber single-shot
pistol is an excellent arm, provided one
has had some previous experience in its use.
It is not a burden on the belt, and a handful of
cartridges in the pocket are not noticed.</p>

<p>Pack your cartridges in a strong canvas bag,
your gun grease and accessories in another receptacle.</p>

<p>On the belt also carry a broad-pointed four-inch
blade skinning knife of the ordinary
butcher knife shape. This will be your table
knife, as well as cooking and general utility
knife.</p>

<p>In the pocket carry a stout jackknife, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29" name="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
waterproof matchbox, always kept well filled,
and a compass.</p>

<p>A film camera is more practical for the trail
than a plate camera for many reasons, one of
which is weight. Plates are heavy and easily
broken. It is well to have each roll of films
put up separately in a sealed, water-tight tin.
Dealers will supply them thus at five cents extra
for each film roll. A waterproof pantasote
case, too, is better than leather, for leather in a
long-continued rain will become watersoaked,
as before stated.</p>

<p>If a plate camera is carried the plates may
be packed in a small light wooden box&mdash;a
starch box, for instance. The box will protect
them under ordinary circumstances. Film rolls,
however, may be carried in a small canvas bag
that will slip into one of the larger waterproof
bags.</p>

<p>My object in outlining outfit is rather to emphasize
the possibilities of selecting a light and
efficient outfit that may be easily packed and
transported on the trail, than to evolve an infallible
check list; therefore I shall not attempt
to name in detail toilet articles, tobacco and
odds and ends. Take nothing, however, save
those things you will surely find occasion to
use, unless I may suggest an extra pipe, should
your pipe be lost. A small balloon silk bag will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30" name="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
hold them, together with a sewing case containing
needles, thread, patches and some safety
pins. Another will hold the hand towels and
hand soap in daily use, while an extra hand
towel may be stowed in your duffle bag.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter it may be pertinent
to say that the novice on the trail is pretty
certain to burden himself with many things he
will seldom or never use. Take your outfitter
into your confidence. Tell him what sort of a
trip you contemplate and he will advise you.
First-class outfitters are usually practical out-of-door
men and camping experts. They have
made an extended study of the subject, for it
is part of their business to do so. Therefore,
in selecting outfit, it is both safe and wise to
rely upon the advice of any responsible outfitter.</p>

FOOD</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">The</span> true wilderness voyager is willing to
endure some discomforts on the trail,
to work hard and submit to black flies
and other pests, but as a reward he usually demands
satisfying meals. There is, indeed, no
reason for him to deny himself a variety and
a plenty, unless his trip is to extend into months.
Weight on the portage trail is always the consideration
that cuts down the ration. Packing
on one's back a ration to be used two or three
months hence is discouraging.</p>

<p>I have evolved a two-week food supply for
two men, based upon the United States army
ration, varied as the result of my own experiences
have dictated. It offers not only great
variety, but is an exceedingly bountiful ration
even for hungry men. Personal taste will suggest
some eliminations or substitutions that
may be made without material loss or change in
weight. If there is certainty of catching fish
or killing game, or if opportunity offers for
purchasing fresh supplies along the trail, re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ductions
in quantity may be made accordingly.
For each additional man, or for any period beyond
two weeks, a proportionate increase in
quantity may be made.</p>

<ul class="list">
    <li>Bacon, 6 pounds.</li>
    <li>Salt fat pork, 2 pounds.</li>
    <li>Ham or canned meats, 5 pounds.</li>

    <li>Pepper, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> ounce.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives each man a nominal ration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
14<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pounds a week, or about two pounds
a day. In reality, however, it is more bountiful
than the summer garrison ration and far more
liberal than the summer marching ration of the
army. This is brought about by the pretty
general elimination of water, largely through
the substitution of dehydrated vegetables and
fruits for fresh and canned goods. The dehydrated
products designated are in every particular
equal to fresh products and far superior
to canned goods. Dehydrated vegetables
possess all the qualities, in fact, of fresh vegetables,
with only the large percentage of water
removed. Water is introduced restoring them
to original form usually by boiling. No chemical
is used as a preservative as is the case with
all dried vegetables put up by foreign manufacturers.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that butter has been omitted
and that "Crisco" has been introduced in
the place of lard and to be used in cooking instead
of butter. Crisco is a product of edible
vegetable oils. It has the appearance of lard
but can be heated to a much higher temperature
without burning, is fully equal to butter when
used as shortening, and dough bread, fish or
other articles of food fried in it will not absorb
it so readily as they will lard, nor will it
transmit the flavor of one food to another. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
example, fish may be fried in Crisco, and dough
bread or anything else fried in the same Crisco
will have not the slightest flavor of fish. It
will keep fresh and sweet under conditions that
turn lard and butter rancid. Butter quickly
becomes strong, and the heat of the sun keeps
it in an oily, unpalatable condition, even when
packed in air-tight tins. The most lavish user
of butter will discover that it is no hardship to
go without it when in camp. Crisco, put up
in handy, friction-top cans, can be purchased
from nearly any grocer.</p>

<p>Coffee should be carried in friction-top tins.
On extended trips coffee is too bulky to carry
save as a special treat. A pound of tea will go
as far as many pounds of coffee; therefore on
trips extending beyond three or four weeks the
proportion of tea should be increased and that
of coffee diminished. On short trips, however,
such as we are discussing, there is no reason
and most Americans usually prefer it even
when in camp.</p>

<p>Each article of food should have its individual
bag, to fit into one of the larger waterproof
canvas bags described, though the bacon and
fat pork, each piece wrapped in paraffin
(waxed) paper, may be packed in one bag.
Paraffin paper will protect other packages in
the bag from grease. Several articles of small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
bulk and weight such as dehydrated carrots,
onions, cranberries and green peas each in its
original package or a small muslin bag suitable
in size may be carried in a single balloon
silk bag. The small bags containing such articles
as are not in daily and frequent use should
be stowed in the bottoms of the canvas bags,
while those in constant demand should be at the
top where they can be had without unpacking
the entire bag. Every package or bag should
be plainly labeled with the nature of its contents.
In labeling them use ink, as pencil marks
are too easily obliterated. Where a party is
composed of a sufficient number of people to
make it worth while the party ration for each
day may be weighed out and packed in a separate
receptacle, thus making seven food packages
for each week. This, however, would
be obviously unpractical where there are less
than eight or ten members of the party.</p>

<p>No glass or crockeryware should be used,
not only because of its liability to break, but
because of its unnecessary weight.</p>

<p>A good way to carry the tin of baking powder
is to sink it into the sack of flour. The
flour will protect it and preclude the possibility
of the cover coming off and the contents spilling
out. Do not carry prepared or self-raising
flour on the trail. For many reasons it is un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36" name="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>practical
for trail use, though perhaps most excellent
in the kitchen at home.</p>

<p>Throughout I have accentuated the advisability
of waterproof covers for everything.
Every ounce of water absorbed by tent, bags,
or package covers, adds to the tedium of the
trail by so much unnecessary weight. When
flour carried in an ordinary sack Is exposed to
rain a paste will form next the cloth, and presently
harden into a crust that will protect the
bulk of flour from injury. But the flour used
up in the process of crust forming is a decided
waste, and the paste, retaining a degree of
moisture, increases weight.</p>

<p>I have suggested balloon silk for the small
food bags to fit into the larger waterproofed
canvas bags, not only because it does not absorb
moisture, but because there will be no possibility
of the contents sifting through the
cloth. If these or the cloth from which to
make them cannot be readily obtained, closely
woven muslin will do.</p>

<p>Should the canoeist desire to make his own
bags and should he not find it convenient to purchase
waterproofed canvas, the ordinary canvas
which he will use may be waterproofed by
the following process:</p>

<p>In two gallons of boiling water dissolve three
and one-half ounces of alum. Rain water is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
best, though any soft water will do; but it
<i>must be soft water</i> to obtain the best results.
In another vessel dissolve four ounces of sugar
of lead in two gallons of soft water. Unite the
solutions when they have cleared by pouring
into another vessel No. 1 first, then No. 2.
Let the solution stand over night, decant it into
a tub, free of any sediment that may have
settled, and it is ready for the canvas. The
cloth should be put into the solution, thoroughly
saturated with it and then lightly
wrung out, and hung up to dry. This treatment
will render canvas to a considerable extent,
though not completely, waterproof.</p>

<p>Muslin for the smaller food bags may be
waterproofed by painting it with a saturate solution
of turpentine and paraffin.</p>

<p>Canned goods should be packed snugly in
canvas bags, with cans on end, that the sides,
not the corners or edges, will rest against the
back in portaging.</p>

<p>Camp chests in which to store food or other
articles are carried by some canoeists, but they
add considerable weight to the outfit. The
best and most serviceable camp chest is one of
indestructible fiber. One with an inside measurement
of <span class="dimension">18 &times; 24 &times; 12</span> inches weighs twenty
pounds.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI" name="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br /><br />
THE PORTAGE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">There</span> are several types of pack harness
offered by outfitters, but it is generally
conceded that the best method of
carrying heavy or medium-weight packs is with
the tump line. In tump line carrying the pack
is supported by a broad band of leather passed
across the head&mdash;high up on the forehead&mdash;thus
throwing the weight upon the strong muscles
of the neck, with no shoulder straps or
other support.</p>

<p>Canadian voyageurs, Hudson's Bay Company
packers and Indians use the tump line to
the exclusion of all shoulder-carrying devices.
Indeed, by no other method would it be possible
for them to transport upon their backs
through a rough country the heavy burdens
which they are called upon to carry. Experienced
packers with the tump line will sometimes
portage loads of upwards of four hundred
pounds. In tests of skill I have seen a
man carry in a single load the contents of three
barrels of flour&mdash;588 pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The tump line consists of a broad piece of
leather some eighteen or twenty inches in
length (known as the head strap or headpiece),
with a leather thong usually about seven
feet in length attached to each end, the total
length from the tip end of one thong to the tip
end of the other thong averaging about sixteen
feet.</p>

<p>Sometimes the two thongs are sewn to the
headpiece, and again the line is a single strip of
leather, broadened in the center to form the
headpiece. The best tump lines, however, have
the head strap as a separate piece with a buckle
at each end by which the thongs are attached.
This arrangement admits of adjustment, if
necessary, to suit the individual after the pack
has been made up.</p>

<p>There is a knack in tump line carrying, but
the following directions for making up various
packs will give the novice sufficient insight, with
a little experience, to enable him to acquire the
art.</p>

<p>When the pack is to be made up wholly of
bags, lay the tump line on the ground with the
thongs parallel to each other and from sixteen
to twenty inches apart, depending upon the
length of the bags to be packed. Place the
bags across the thongs, one bag upon another,
taking care that the thongs are not so near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
ends of the bags as to render them liable to
slip off when the pack is tied. Now lift the
head strap above the top bag and secure the
pack by drawing the loose end of each thong
in turn tight around the bags and knotting it a
few inches below the buckle that attaches its
other end to the headpiece.</p>

<p>When a pack cloth is to be used, spread the
pack cloth upon the thongs of the tump line,
stretched upon the ground in the manner above
described, and in the center of the pack cloth
lay folded blankets and other articles to be
packed, making the pile about two feet long,
and taking care that hard substances are in the
center, with blankets and soft things outside.
Now turn the sides of the pack cloth over the
pack and fold over the ends. If a bag is to be
included, lay it upon the pack after the cloth
has been folded, and secure the whole as in
the former case.</p>

<p>Another method of making up a pack with
the pack cloth, common among Canadian voyageurs,
is as follows: Spread the cloth upon
the ground, and lay the tump line across it, the
headpiece near one end and the thongs a foot
from the sides. Fold the sides of the cloth inward
over each thong. Now build up the pack
in a neat pile about two feet long on the folded
cloth, taking care as before that hard things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41" name="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
are placed in the middle. Fold the end of the
pack cloth with protruding thongs over the
pack, take a half turn with the loose end of a
thong around the other end near the headpiece,
draw it tight until the end is closely puckered,
then knot it and draw up the other thong and
secure it in like manner. Now bring the free
ends of the tump line to center of pack, on top,
cross them and pass them around middle of
pack and tie.</p>

<p>The knack of comfortable tump line carrying
once the neck muscles have become developed
and hardened to the work is in properly
balancing the pack. With the headpiece
resting high up upon the forehead the pack
should hang with its bottom no lower than the
hips. Neither should it be too high. A little
experimenting will teach just where the proper
balance is to be found. If it is too high,
lengthen the line, or if too low shorten it by
means of the buckles which attach the thongs
to the headpiece.</p>

<p>Experienced packers pile additional bags or
bundles on top of the pack, the uppermost
bundle standing higher than the head. In my
own experience I have found that an additional
bag thus placed upon the pack and resting
against the back of my neck helped balance the
load. My favorite bag for this purpose is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42" name="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
forty or fifty pound bag of flour, sometimes
surmounted by a lighter bundle which rested
partly upon the flour and partly upon my head.</p>

<p>The tenderfoot will be quite content to limit
his early loads to sixty or seventy pounds, and
even then his first portages will not be what he
can conscientiously term experiences of unalloyed
joy. Gradually, however, he will learn
the knack of tump packing and at the end of a
couple of weeks of daily experience will find
himself able to negotiate a load of one hundred
pounds with some ease.</p>

<p>All the various types of pack harness are
supplied with straps by which the pack is secured
and loops through which to slip the arms,
the pack being carried from the shoulders instead
of the head. With this sort of a pack,
as with the tump line, care should be given to
the proper adjustment, with the bottom of the
pack no lower than the hips. Fifty pounds is
about as heavy a load as one can comfortably
carry from the shoulders.</p>

<p>Outfitters sometimes attach a headpiece to
their pack harness&mdash;that is to say the harness
is provided with both shoulder loops and tump
line head strap. The object is to secure a division
of weight between shoulders and head.
This is a method employed by Eskimos when
hunting without dogs. The Eskimo hunter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43" name="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
binds his pack with sealskin thongs, and manipulates
a single thong in such a manner as not
only to secure the pack but to form arm loops
and headpiece as well.</p>

<p>No matter what type of shoulder harness is
employed, a breast strap must be used to fasten
together the arm loops in front or the loops
will have a continual tendency to slip backward
and off the shoulders. This breast strap fastens
the packer so securely to his pack that should
he slip, as is sometimes likely, the pack will
carry him down with it and the probability of
injury is multiplied many times. This alone is
a very decided objection to all forms of pack
harness.</p>

<p>If one slips with a tump line, on the contrary,
a slight twist of the head will disengage and
free one from the pack; and if one is hunting
the tump pack may readily be dropped at a moment's
notice, should game be sighted.</p>

<p>Let me therefore urge the adoption of the
tump line for all portage work where fifty
pounds or more must be transported. No experienced
packer will use harness. Harness
packing is indeed indicative of the tenderfoot
who has never learned how, unless on long
cross country tramps with light loads.</p>

<p>But on a canoe trip, if one would make progress,
big loads must be resorted to. For in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44" name="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>stance,
if the canoeist has a two mile portage to
negotiate and one hundred pounds of duffle he
has but two miles to walk if he carries all his
duffle at once, but if he makes two loads of it
he must walk six miles. With the hundred
pound load the portage may easily be covered
in one hour. With fifty pound loads three
hours will be consumed, for there will be time
lost in making up the second pack.</p>

<p>Axes, guns and extra paddles may be thrust
under the thongs of the tump line, or carried
in the hand. Never portage a rifle with a cartridge
in the chamber, and never portage a
loaded shotgun. To disregard this advice will
be to take an unnecessary and foolhardy risk.</p>

<p>Save in a rather stiff breeze, one man can
carry a canoe weighing less than one hundred
pounds nearly as easily as two can carry it.
There is one best way of doing everything, and
the best and most practical way to carry a canoe
is the Indian's way.</p>

<p>Tie one end of a stout string or thong securely
to the middle thwart close to the gunwale,
and the other end to the same thwart
close to the opposite gunwale with the string
stretched taut from end to end of the thwart
and on top of it. Slip the blades of two paddles,
lying side by side, under the string, the
paddle handles lying on the forward thwart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
With the handles as close together as they will
lie, bind them with a piece of rope or thong to
the center of the forward thwart.</p>

<p>Spread the blades upon the middle thwart
sufficiently wide apart to admit your head between
them. Take a position on the left side
of the canoe facing the stern. Just forward of
the middle thwart grasp the gunwale on the opposite
or right side of the canoe in your left
hand and the gunwale on the near or left side
in your right hand, and, lifting the canoe over
your head, let the flat side of the paddles directly
forward of the middle thwart rest upon
the shoulders, your head between them. It will
be found that though you faced the stern in
lifting the canoe you are now facing the bow,
and with the bow slightly elevated the canoe
can be carried with ease and a view of the trail
ahead will not be shut out.</p>

<p>Should the flat paddle blades resting upon
the shoulders be found uncomfortable, as they
doubtless will at the end of the first two or
three hundred yards, a Pontiac shirt or sweater
will serve as a protecting pad.</p>

<p>Outfitters offer for sale yokes, pneumatic
pads and contrivances of various sorts as protections
for the shoulders, but these contrivances
elevate the canoe from two to four inches
above the shoulders and this increases the diffi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>culty
of steadying it on rough trail. The
sweater or Pontiac shirt eases the cutting effect
of the paddles just as well as any of the special
portaging pads, and the canoe can be handled
more easily with it. Besides it makes one less
thing to look after.</p>

<p>In a strong breeze it is often difficult for one
man to handle a canoe, for the wind striking it
on the side will turn the portager around and
he will find it impossible to keep his course in
spite of his best efforts. If the portage is a
short one&mdash;two or three hundred yards&mdash;the
canoe may be carried very well, one man with
the bow the other with the stern upon a
shoulder, the canoe on its side with the bottom
next the portagers' heads, that they may easily
grasp the gunwale in one hand and steady the
canoe with the other.</p>

<p>This position will soon be found exceedingly
tiresome, and on portages exceeding two or
three hundred yards the paddles should be arranged
with the blades on the after thwart and
the handles lashed to the center of the middle
thwart. With this arrangement one man carries
exactly as when portaging the canoe alone,
save that he stands under the canoe just forward
of the after thwart instead of the middle
thwart, while the other man carries the bow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
upon one shoulder. This is the easiest method
of two-man portaging of which I know.</p>

<p>Many odds and ends may be tucked in the
canoe on the portage&mdash;fishing rods, for example,
in cases, with one end stuck in the bow
and the other end tied to the forward thwart.</p>

<p>Should a canvas canoe become punctured it
may be repaired by one of the following
methods:</p>

<p>If a stick of canoe cement is in the outfit,
heat the cement with a match and smear it
over the puncture.</p>

<p>Should the outfit contain a canoe repair kit,
cut a patch of canvas somewhat larger than the
puncture, apply a coat of white lead to the
puncture and over a marginal space as large
as the canvas patch, press the patch firmly and
evenly upon the white lead and tack it down
with copper tacks. To this apply calor, and
when dry complete the repairs with a coat of
varnish.</p>

<p>Should marine glue be used, lay a sheet of it
over the puncture, heat the bottom of a cup or
some other smooth metal utensil and rub it
over the glue until the glue melts sufficiently to
fill the puncture.</p>

<p>In a region where spruce gum can be had,
melt a quantity of gum in a frying pan with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
sufficient grease to take from the gum its brittle
quality when cold. While hot pour the
gum upon the rupture, letting it run well into
the opening and smearing it smoothly over the
outside.</p>

<p>"Peterborough" canoes are also easily repaired
with marine glue or gum.</p>

<p>In loading the canoe place the heavier bags
in the bottom and middle of the canoe, taking
care so to distribute the weight that when fully
loaded the canoe will lie on an even keel.
Keep the load always as low down as possible.
Every bag rising above the gunwales offers resistance
to the wind, and tends to make the
load topheavy. When but one man occupies a
canoe, however, sufficient weight should be carried
forward to counterbalance his weight in
the stern.</p>

<p>Lash everything fast, particularly in rough
water or when running rapids. It does not pay
to take chances. With a companion I was once
turned over in a rapid in an unexplored,
sparsely timbered wilderness several hundred
miles from the nearest base of supplies&mdash;a
Hudson's Bay trading post. Nearly all our
food was lost, as well as guns, axes, cooking
utensils and many other necessities of travel.
The temperature stood close to zero, snow covered
the ground and during the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the three weeks occupied in reaching the post
we had to dig driftwood from under the snow,
and our ingenuity was taxed at times to the
utmost in efforts to protect ourselves from the
elements and travel with any degree of comfort.
Nothing worse than an unpleasant ducking
in icy waters would have resulted from our
accident had we observed the rule of ordinary
caution and lashed our outfit to the thwarts.</p>

<p>One end of a rope tied to the forward
thwart, the other end threaded through bag
handles or pack lashings and secured to the after
thwart, will do the trick. A short strap,
one end attached to a thwart, the other end supplied
with a snap to fasten on rifle or shotgun
cases, is a good way to secure the guns and
still have them readily accessible.</p>

<p>If you would make speed be smart in unloading
the canoe and making up your packs
on the portage, and equally smart in reloading
the canoe. Delays in loading, unloading and
making up packs are the chief causes of slow
progress.</p>

<p>When it is found necessary to "track," give
the rear end of the tracking line a turn around
the forward thwart, on the land side of the
canoe, then pass the end back and secure it to
the middle thwart. This distributes the strain
between the thwarts. While one man at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50" name="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
farther end of the line tows the canoe, the
other man with a pole may walk upon the bank,
and keep the canoe clear of snags, if the water
is deep. Should the water be shallow it will
usually be found necessary for him to wade
and guide the bow through open channels.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII" name="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br /><br />
TRAVEL WITH SADDLE AND PACK ANIMALS</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">Under</span> this head we shall consider: (1)
Saddles and pack equipment; (2)
Animals best adapted to pack work;
(3) Outfit and provisions and how to pack them;
(4) How to throw some practical hitches; (5)
Equipment of the traveler who has no pack
animal and whose saddle horse is required to
transport both rider and equipment.</p>

<p>Comfort on the trail depends to a very large
degree upon the animals of the outfit. A mean
horse is an abomination, and a horse may be
mean in many respects. A bucking horse, a
horse that shies at stumps and other objects or
at every moving thing, or one that is frightened
by sudden and unexpected sounds is not only
an uncomfortable but unsafe animal to ride
upon rugged mountain trails; and a horse that
will not stand without hitching, or one that is
hard to catch when hobbled and turned loose,
will cause no end of trouble.</p>

<p>In choosing a horse, then, avoid so far as
possible one with these tendencies, and also ob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52" name="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>serve
the manner in which he handles his feet.
He should not be subject to stumbling. He
should be sure-footed, steady and reliable, to
qualify him for work on dangerous trails; this
is of the first importance. A horse that does
not keep his eyes on the trail and select his
footing with care is wholly unsuited to mountain
work. He should be gunwise. A gunwise
horse will not be easily frightened by sudden
and unexpected noises.</p>

<p>Whether intended for mountain or plains
work, the horse should be a good camp animal&mdash;that
is, one that will not wander far from
camp. It is more than aggravating to find upon
arising in the morning that your horse has disappeared
and one always feels that time consumed
in searching for a roving horse is time
worse than wasted. Of course this tendency of
an animal can be forestalled by picketing him,
but a picketed horse unless forage be particularly
good will not do well, for it rarely happens
in these days of sheep-ravaged ranges that
an animal can find sufficient food to meet his requirements
within the limited length of a
picket rope.</p>

<p>Some horses need much persuasion before
they can be induced to ford streams, and I have
had them lose their nerve and decline the descent
of precipitous trails. An animal possess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53" name="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ing
this trait of timidity is not suited to trail
work, for he is likely to cause trouble at a critical
moment.</p>

<p>Some horses are good foragers, others are
not. A poor forager will become leg weary
and break down much more quickly than the
animal that takes advantage of every opportunity
to graze or browse. A horse just in
from the open range should be round and full-bellied.
This is an indication that he is a good
feeder. Generally speaking the chunky horse
is the one best adapted to arduous trail work
because he usually possesses greater powers of
endurance than the longer, lankier type.</p>

<p>All of the qualifications above enumerated
should be borne in mind in selecting animals,
whether for saddle or pack use. And of course
the animals should be as sound as possible.
One should never start upon a journey with an
animal that is lame or has cinch sores or galled
back.</p>

<p>When mountain trails are to be negotiated
a saddle horse weighing from nine hundred to
a thousand pounds will be found better adapted
to the work than a larger animal. Too large a
horse is liable to be clumsy on the trail, while
too light a horse will of course tire under a
heavy rider. A small horse, as a rule, is better
able to forage a living than a large horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54" name="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
for this reason stands up better with a moderate
load on long, continuous journeys. Ponies
weighing from eight hundred to eight hundred
and fifty pounds will pack one hundred and
fifty pounds easily, and ponies of this size make
much better pack animals than larger ones.</p>

<p>While for general saddle work I prefer a
horse, a mule is surer footed and therefore
preferable on precipitous, narrow mountain
trails. In the Sierra Madres of Mexico I rode
a mule over trails where I would scarcely have
trusted a horse. Good saddle mules, however,
are scarce. I never saw a really good saddle-broke
mule north of Mexico, though they are
doubtless to be had. Mules have greater
powers of endurance than horses, and for many
other reasons are superior as pack animals.
The chief objection to a mule is his timidity
upon marshy trails. His feet are much smaller
than those of a horse, he mires easily, and he is
fully aware of the fact. A good mule, nevertheless,
is the one best all-around pack animal.</p>

<p>Burros are good where forage is scarce, but
they are slow. When the burro decides that he
has done a day's work he stops, and that is the
end of it. He will not consult you, and he will
not take your advice. When he fully decides
that he will go no farther you may as well unpack
and make camp with as good grace as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55" name="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
you can muster, and keep your temper. I believe
that burros have a well-organized labor
union and they will not do one stroke of work
beyond the limit prescribed by their organization.
But one must sometimes resort to them
in desert travel. They will pick their living and
thrive on sage brush wastes where other animals
would die, and their ability to go long
without water is truly remarkable. On rough
mountain trails they are even more sure-footed
if possible than mules, but like the mule it is
difficult to force them over marshes or into
rivers when fording is necessary.</p>

<p>In horse-raising localities in the West very
good horses can be had at anywhere from
thirty to seventy-five dollars. The usual rate
for horse rental is one dollar to one dollar and
a half a day, and it is therefore cheaper, when
the journey is to extend to a month or more, to
purchase the animals outright and sell them
when you are finished with them for what they
will bring. Rented animals are generally animals
of low value and sometimes not very
efficient, and in the course of a month one pays
in rental a good share of the value of the horse.
The risk is no greater, for if a rented horse is
injured while in a traveler's possession, the
owner holds him who has rented the animal responsible
for the damage.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII" name="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br /><br />
SADDLE AND PACK EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">The</span> riding saddle should be a double
cinch, horn saddle, with wool-lined
skirts and of ample weight to hold its
position. My own is a regular stock saddle
weighing thirty-five pounds, though for all ordinary
use a twenty-five- or thirty-pound saddle
will do just as well.</p>

<p>I prescribe the horn saddle because of its
convenience. One may sling upon it a camera,
binoculars or other articles in frequent demand,
and when it becomes necessary to lead a pack
pony the lead rope may be attached to it. For
this latter purpose the horn is indeed indispensable.</p>

<p>In the light of personal experience with both
single and double cinch saddles, I recommend
the latter unhesitatingly, particularly for mountain
work. In steep ascents or descents it will
not slide, while a single cinch saddle is certain
to do so no matter how tightly cinched, and this
shifting will sooner or later gall the horse's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
back. In Mexico the single cinch saddle is almost
universally used, but who ever saw a
Mexican's horse that was free from saddle
sores? The forward cinch should preferably
be a hair cinch, though the ordinary webbed
sort, both forward and rear, does well enough.</p>

<p>The saddle blanket should be a thick, good
quality wool blanket. In Arizona Navajo saddle
blankets are popular, and they are undoubtedly
the best when obtainable. A hair
saddle pad or corona, shaped to the animal's
back and used in connection with the blanket, is
a pretty good insurance against galling, and
preferable to the felt pad, for it is cooler.</p>

<p>A leather boot for rifle, and saddle bags for
toilet articles, note books and odds and ends,
bridle, halter rope, a pair of cowboy spurs with
large blunt rowels, and a quirt to tickle delinquent
pack horses will be needed. The rifle
boot has two sling straps. The usual method
of carrying it is to insert it between the stirrup
leathers on the near side, drop the sling strap
at the top of the boot over the saddle pommel
and buckle the sling strap at the bottom of the
boot into the rear latigo ring. By detaching
the latter sling from the boot before buckling
it to the ring, the boot may be removed from
or attached to the saddle by simply lifting the
forward sling strap over the pommel, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
unbuckling. In case the sling strap at the top
of the boot be placed too far down, it should
be shifted higher up and secured to the boot
with a leather loop which may be riveted to the
boot.</p>

<p>For the pack animals the ordinary cross-tree

is the most practical
pack saddle for all-around
use, though the
aparejo, used by the

throughout Mexico, is
superior to the sawbuck
when unwieldy
packages of irregular

<p>The aparejo is of Arabian origin, and the
Spaniards, who adopted it from the Moors, introduced
it into Mexico. In Mexico there are
two types of the aparejo in common use. One
made usually of the fiber of <i>henequen</i>, which is
woven into pockets which are stuffed with
grass, to form the pads, is used on donkeys in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60" name="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
comparatively light packing; in the other type
the pad casing is made of Mexican tanned
leather instead of <i>henequen</i> matting but also
stuffed with grass. This is used in heavier
packing with mules, in transporting machinery
and supplies to mines and merchandise to inland
settlements.</p>

<p>The cross-tree or sawbuck, however, is used
almost exclusively in the United States by forest
rangers, cowboys, prospectors and pack
travelers generally, and it is to this type of
pack saddle that we shall direct our attention
chiefly. It may be interesting to note that this
is a very ancient type of pack saddle, of Asiatic
origin. It consists of two saddle boards
connected near each end&mdash;front and rear&mdash;by
two cross-pieces, the pommel and cantle forming
a miniature sawbuck, while the saddle
boards are similar in shape to the McClellan
saddle tree. This is fitted with breeching, quarter
straps, breast strap, latigos and cinch. As
in the case of the riding saddle, the sawbuck
pack saddle should be supplied with the double
cinch. Care should be taken that the saddle
fits the animal for which intended. A saddle
either too wide or too narrow will be certain to
cause a sore back.</p>

<p>Each pack saddle should be accompanied by
a heavy woolen saddle blanket, which should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61" name="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
folded into three or four thicknesses, for here
even greater protection is necessary than with
the riding saddle, for the animal is to carry a
dead weight.</p>

<p>The preferable method of carrying supplies
with the sawbuck pack saddle is with kyacks,
basket panniers or the <i>alforjas</i>, though with
sling and lash ropes any sort of a bundle may
be slung upon it.</p>

<p>When they can be obtained, kyacks of indestructible
fiber stand first for preference.
These are usually from twenty-two to twenty-four
inches wide, seventeen or eighteen inches
high and about nine inches deep, and are fitted
with heavy leather loops for slinging on the
saddle. Unless the horse is a large one, the
narrower, or twenty-two inch, should be selected.</p>

<p>Basket panniers of similar size are lighter
but not so well adapted to hard usage, and are
more expensive.</p>

<p>The alforjas is constructed of heavy duck
and leather, and of the same dimensions as the
kyack. They are much cheaper than either
panniers or kyacks, and are therefore more
commonly used. Any outfitter can supply them.
They are slung upon the saddle in the same
manner as kyacks. A pair of the type decided
upon will be required for each animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62" name="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The next requirement is a half-inch lash
rope. This should be at least thirty-three, but
preferably forty feet in length. In some respects
a cotton rope is preferable to one of
hemp, though the latter is more commonly
used, and regulations prescribe it for army
pack trains.</p>

<p>A good broad cinch should be provided,
fitted with a ring on one end to which is attached
the lash or lair rope and a cinch hook on
the other end.</p>

<p>There should be a pair of hobbles for each
animal, and a blind to put upon obstreperous
pack animals when slinging and lashing the
load. These may be purchased throughout the
West at almost any village store. It is well
also to carry a bell, which should always be
strapped around the neck of one of the horses
when the animals are hobbled and turned loose
to graze.</p>

<p>It will sometimes be necessary to picket one
of the animals, and for this purpose fifty or
sixty feet of half or five-eighth inch rope will
be required. Also sufficient leading rope should
be provided for each pack animal, and a halter
rope for the saddle horse. A lariat carried
upon the saddle pommel will be found useful in
a dozen ways, and may be utilized for picketing
horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63" name="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>All horses should be "slick" shod; that is,
shod with uncalked shoes. The shoes should
be of soft iron, not so light as to render them
liable to bend before they are worn out, and
they should not extend beyond the hoof at side
or rear. Some extra shoes of proper size for
each animal, a horseshoer's nippers, rasp,
hammer and some nails should be included in
the equipment.</p>

PERSONAL OUTFIT FOR THE SADDLE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">The</span> outfit recommended in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_III" title="Camp Equipment for the Canoe Trip">III</a>
and <a href="#CHAPTER_IV" title="Personal Equipment">IV</a> in discussing camp and personal
equipment for canoe trips is, with the
modifications and additions which we shall now
consider, equally well adapted to saddle and
pack horse travel. As previously stated, our
object is to describe methods of packing, rather
than to formulate an infallible check list. With
this in view an efficient outfit that may be
easily packed and transported is outlined, in a
general way, and therefore such articles of outfit
mentioned in previous chapters as are obviously
useful only in canoe travel will not be
referred to in this connection.</p>

<p>The wedge, the Hudson Bay, the forest
ranger and the lean-to tent are all good models
for pack animal travel, and easily erected.
Whichever type is chosen, if made of any one
of the light-weight materials described, will be
found both satisfactory and easily packed. For
example, a forest ranger's tent eight feet deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65" name="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and eight feet wide weighs less than four
pounds, while a lean-to with approximately the
same floor space weighs about three pounds. In
the more arid regions of the West one rarely
finds it necessary to pitch a tent, though it is
handy to have one along and well worth carrying,
particularly should it be desired to remain
more than one night at any point.</p>

<p>During the summer, save in high altitudes,
one pair of light woolen blankets will be found
ample bedding. For all probable conditions
of weather, however, in tent or in the open,
the sleeping bag is the most convenient and at
the same time the most comfortable camp bed
yet devised, and it is so easily carried on the
pack horse that I advise its adoption. One
made of close-woven waterproofed canvas is
the most thoroughly practical bag for general
use. This should be lined with two pairs of
light blankets, that four thicknesses of blanket
may be available for covering. The blankets
should be so arranged that they may be taken
out and the bag turned for airing. One may
adapt such a bag to the temperature, using as
many or as few thicknesses of blanket as desired,
depending upon the number with which
the bag is lined. I recently saw a bag lined
with four thicknesses of llama wool duffel
(providing two thicknesses for cover) that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66" name="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
weighed but eight pounds and furnished ample
protection for any weather down to a zero
temperature.</p>

<p>Pack cloths or light tarpaulins <span class="dimension">6 &times; 7</span> feet,
used to cover and protect the packs, will be
needed for each pack animal, and at night the
bed may be spread upon them. Saddle bags
make excellent pillows.</p>

<p>In traveling in an arid region canteens are a
necessity. There should be one large one for
each traveler to be carried on the pack horse,
and a small one swung upon the saddle horn
will be found convenient for ready use.</p>

<p>A folding water bucket of waterproofed
canvas should also be included in the outfit.</p>

<p>The aluminum reflecting baker which has
been described is far preferable to the Dutch
oven&mdash;a heavy iron kettle with iron cover&mdash;not
only because it weighs far less and is much
more easily packed, but because it is more practical.
Westerners are wedded to the Dutch
oven, and this reference is merely made as a
suggestion in case the question of choice between
the two should arise.</p>

<p>If kyacks or alforjas are used the large
water-proofed canvas duffle bags and food bags
will not be required. The smaller balloon silk
or musline food bags, however, will be found
fully as convenient in packing in the pack horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67" name="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
kyack as in the canvas bags on the canoe trip.</p>

<p>Each rider should be provided with either
a saddle slicker or a poncho, which when not
in use may be rolled and secured to the saddle
directly behind the seat by means of tie strings
attached to the saddle. A poncho is preferable
to a slicker, because of the many uses to
which it may be put.</p>

<p>On saddle journeys in cold, windy weather
a wind-proof canvas coat or a large, roomy
buckskin shirt is a comfort. If a buckskin
shirt is adapted, have it made plain without
fringe or frill. Wilderness dwellers formerly
fringed their buckskin shirts, not alone for
ornament, but to facilitate the drying of the
garment when wet. In the fringed shirt water,
instead of settling around the bottom of the
shirt, around the yoke and the seams of the
sleeve, will drain to the fringe which the wind
quickly dries. In our case, however, the poncho
will protect the shirt from a wetting.</p>

<p>In summer, in an arid or desert region of
the Southwest, athletic summer underwear will
be found entirely satisfactory. Whether this
or light wool is to be worn, however, will
depend entirely upon the season and the region
to be visited.</p>

<p>In very warm weather a close-woven, good
quality khaki outer shirt is both comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68" name="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and practical; but on chilly autumn days a flannel
shirt should take its place&mdash;gray, brown,
blue&mdash;the color does not matter so long as it
does not crock. It is my custom to have one
khaki and one flannel shirt in my outfit.</p>

<p>Trousers should be of heavy khaki, medium
weight moleskin, or other strong close-woven
material. Full-length trousers, with reinforced
seat, are preferable in some respects to riding
breeches, and may be worn with the regulation
United States cavalry puttee leggings with
shoes.</p>

<p>Some riders prefer top boots, such as Arizona
cowboys wear, and but for their high
heels which make walking uncomfortable they
would be admirable. High-laced, medium-weight
mountaineering shoes will eliminate the
necessity of puttees, and many prefer them to
low-laced shoes and puttees. In snowy, cold
weather I have found heavy German socks and
ordinary shoes, large enough to avoid the possibility
of pinching the feet, admirable footwear
for the saddle. But whatever is decided
upon, extra trousers, extra leggings and extra
shoes are superfluous. One pair of each&mdash;the
pair worn&mdash;is sufficient.</p>

<p>The hat should be of the Western style, with
broad brim, and of the best grade. The brims
of the cheaper ones are sure to sag after a lit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>tle
wear and exposure to a shower or two. A
good reliable hat may be had for five dollars
that will stand several years of hard wear and
may be renovated when soiled, assuming again
the freshness of a new hat. I have one for
which I paid fourteen pesos in Monterey, Mexico,
in 1907. I have worn It pretty steadily
since in camp and on the trail. It has been
twice renovated, and to-day so nearly resembles
a new hat that I am not ashamed to wear
it about town.</p>

<p>Heavy gauntlet buckskin gloves are a necessary
protection, not only against cold in frosty
weather, but against brush in summer. The
regulation United States cavalry glove is the
best that I have discovered for all-around hard
usage, and will not harden after a wetting.</p>

<p>The saddle rifle should be short and light&mdash;not
over twenty-four-inch barrel, and not above
seven pounds in weight. A revolver is never
needed, though for target practice one offers
a means of amusement.</p>

<p>Unless going into permanent camp or into
an isolated region, it will hardly be found necessary
to start out with more than one week's
provisions. Before these are consumed settlements
will be reached, where fresh supplies
may be purchased. It is well to have along a
few cans of baked beans and corned or roast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70" name="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
beef, that a hasty meal may be prepared when
time does not allow a sufficient halt to permit
the preparation of uncooked foods. Two or
three dozen lemons should also be provided,
particularly in summer, and in more or less
arid regions.</p>

<p>Provisions and general outfit should be
neatly packed in small bags, and evenly distributed
in the kyacks.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X" name="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br /><br />
ADJUSTING THE PACK</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">In</span> saddling up, be sure that the saddle
blanket is folded large enough to protect
the horse's sides from the pack, when the
pack is slung into place. Otherwise the kyacks
or alforjas will be liable with constant chafing
when the horse is in motion to cause sores. Not
only where the saddle rests upon the blanket
but where the pack rests upon the horse's sides
there should be sufficient thicknesses of blanket
to overcome friction, and this demands a
greater thickness than under the riding saddle,
for the pack load is a dead load. After the
pack saddle is thrown into place, and before
cinching it, ease the blanket by pulling it up
slightly under the center of the saddle&mdash;along
the backbone of the animal. This will overcome
the tendency of the blanket to draw down
and bind the horse's back too tightly when the
saddle is cinched and the pack in place.</p>

<p>When packing the kyacks or alforjas particular
care should be taken to have the pair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72" name="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
for each horse evenly balanced as to weight.
If the load swung on one side of the horse is
heavier than that on the opposite side, there
will be a continual drawing down of the pack
saddle on the heavier side, resulting almost
certainly in injury to the animal. Inattention
or willful carelessness on the part of packers in
balancing the pack is five times out of six the
cause which leads to sore-backed pack animals.</p>

<p>If two or more pack animals are used, let
such provisions and utensils as are in constant
use and will be needed at once by the cook, be
packed on one animal. Hobbles and bell
should also be carried on this animal. This
will be the first animal unpacked, and while the
other animals are being unpacked the cook may
get busy, and the packer will have hobbles and
bell at hand to immediately attach to the animals.</p>

<p>Attached to each end of the kyacks and
alforjas is a leathern loop or sling strap. By
means of these loops kyacks and alforjas are
hung to the saddle, one loop fitting over the
forward, the other over the rear cruz, or fork.
The kyacks should be so adjusted as to hang
evenly one with the other. That is to say, one
kyack should hang no lower upon the animal's
side than the other, and both should hang as
high as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73" name="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The kyacks in place, hobbles, bell, and such
odds and ends as it may not be convenient to
pack in the kyack, may be laid on the center
between the crosstrees and on top of the kyack,
and over all smoothly folded blankets, sleeping
bags, or tent, care being exercised to keep the
pack as low and smooth as possible. Everything
carefully placed and adjusted, cover the
pack with the pack cloth or tarpaulin, folded to
proper size to protect the whole pack, but with
no loose ends extending beyond it to catch upon
brush or other obstructions. If inconvenient
to include within the pack, the cooking outfit
in its canvas case may be lashed to the top
of pack after the final hitch has been tied.
All is ready now for the hitch that is to bind
the pack into place.</p>

<p>Frequently the traveler is not provided with
either kyacks or alforjas, and it becomes necessary
to pack the load without the convenience
of these receptacles. Before considering the
hitches, therefore, let us describe methods of
slinging the load in such cases upon the crosstree
saddle.</p>

<p>The load which is to be slung from the
crosstree should be arranged in two compact
packages of equal weight, one for each side of
the animal. Boxes may be used, but large,
strong sacks are preferable. The large can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74" name="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>vas
duffle bags, described in the chapter on
canoe outfitting, are well adapted to the purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter illustration" id="i74">
    <img src="images/074.png" alt="Illustration" />
    <div class="caption">
        <p class="center">
            <span class="smcap">Sling for Packing on Crosstree Saddle</span>
        </p>
        <p>A is forward cruz, B rear cruz of saddle. CC are loops
        which support packages. D and E are ends or hauling
        parts of rope.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Take the sling rope, and, standing on the
near side, throw one end over the horse's neck
just forward of the saddle. Now at about
the middle of the rope form two half hitches,
or a clove hitch, on the forward cruz or fork
of the saddle.</p>

<p>With the free end of the rope on the near
side form a half hitch on the rear cruz, allowing
sufficient loop between the forward and
rear cruz to receive the side pack, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75" name="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
free end of the rope falling under the loop.
Now go to the off side and arrange the rope
on that side in similar manner.</p>

<p>Lift the offside pack into position with its
forward end even with the forward fork, lifting
the pack well up to the forks. Hold the
pack in position with the palm of the right hand
against the center of the pack, and with the left
hand pass the loop along the lower side of the
pack, drawing in the slack with the free end
of the rope, which passes around the rear fork
and under the center of the pack. With the
pack drawn snugly in position, take a turn
with the free end of the rope around the rope
along the side of the pack. This will hold
the pack in position. Tie a bowline knot in
the end of rope, and at proper length for the
bowline loop to reach the center and top of
pack. Place loop where it may be easily
reached from the near side.</p>

<p>Now pass to the near side and sling the near
pack in exactly similar manner, save that no
bowline knot is to be formed. Reach up and
slip the end of the near rope, which you are
holding, through the bowline loop, draw tight
and tie.</p>

<p>The following is another method of slinging
packs, frequently used by forest rangers:</p>

<p>Throw the rope across the horse directly in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76" name="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
front of the saddle, and as in the previous
method form two half hitches with the rope
at its middle on the front fork, but in this case
permitting the ends to lie on the ground on
either side the horse. Place the near pack in
position and against the lower rope, and holding
it with one hand, bring the rope up and
over the pack with the other hand and throw
a half hitch around the forward fork, keeping
the free end of the rope under. Draw the
rope taut, lifting the pack well up. Pass the
running rope back and throw a half hitch
around the rear fork, the loose or running end
of the rope on the under side, as when forming
the half hitch on the front fork. Now
pass the running rope from under over the
pack at the rear, throw a half hitch over the
rear fork, take up all slack, bring the loose
end under and around the two ropes at their
intersection between pack and rear fork, and
tie securely. The pack on off side is slung in
similar manner.</p>

<p>Most mules, and not infrequently horses as
well, have a constitutional dislike to receiving
the pack. If your pack animal displays any
such tendency adjust the blind over his eyes
and let it remain there until the hitch is thrown
and the load tightened and secured. The blind
is usually an effective quieter.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI" name="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br /><br />
SOME PRACTICAL HITCHES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">Whether</span> the load is made up with
kyacks, alforjas, or separate packs
slung to the crosstree saddle as described
in the preceding chapter it must be secured
in place. For this purpose various
hitches are employed by packers, each hitch
well adapted to the particular conditions which
evolved it.</p>

<p>Our description will be confined to the following
six hitches, which furnish ample variety
to suit the exigencies of ordinary circumstances:</p>

<p>(1) The crosstree or squaw hitch, which
is the father of all hitches because from it the
diamond, the double diamond and all pack-train
hitches in present-day use were evolved.</p>

<p>(2) A diamond hitch, adapted to the crosstree
pack saddle. This is a form of single
diamond.</p>

<p>(3) The United States army diamond particularly
adapted for use with the aparejo. The
true double diamond is a hitch rarely called for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78" name="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
save in army work or freighting pack trains,
and will therefore be omitted. There are several
so-called double diamonds that might be
described, but these near-double diamonds possess
little or no advantage over the single diamond,
and we shall pass them over as they are
scarcely resorted to in ordinary pack work.</p>

<p>(4) The one-man or lifting hitch.</p>

<p>(5) The stirrup hitch, to be used when the
packer has rope but no cinch.</p>

<p>(6) The saddle hitch, employed in slinging
loads upon an ordinary riding saddle.</p>

<p>(7) The hitch for packing a sick or injured
man.</p>

<h3>THE CROSSTREE HITCH</h3>

<p>This hitch was introduced into the Northwest
by the early fur traders and adopted by
the Indians. Among Indians, women are the
laborers, and the crosstree hitch being the hitch
almost exclusively employed by the squaws was
presently dubbed by white men the "squaw
hitch." It is a hitch very generally used by
prospectors, and for this reason is known in
some localities as the "prospector's hitch."
In other sections of the West, where sheep
herders commonly use it, it is locally called
the "sheep herder's hitch." It is a hitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79" name="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
easily thrown by one man, holds well, and is
therefore a favorite.</p>

</div>

<p>With lash rope attached to cinch, take a
position on the near side of the animal facing
the pack. Throw the cinch over the top and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80" name="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
center of pack in such manner as to be easily
reached under the horse's belly. Pick up cinch
and engage the rope from in out upon the
hook. Draw up slack, taking care that the
cinch rests properly upon the horse's belly.
Grasp the running and standing rope in left
hand above the hook, to hold slack, and with
the right hand double the running rope and
thrust the doubled portion under the standing
rope from rear forward in a bight, at top of
pack. Enlarge the loop of the bight by drawing
through enough slack rope to make the loop
of sufficient size to be passed over and around
the off side kyack or pack. Step to off side,
turn loop over, and engage it around the ends
and bottom of kyack, from front to rear. Re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81" name="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>turn
to near side, and pass the loose end of
running rope around the forward end, bottom
and finally rear end of kyack. Draw the rope
end, from above down, over and under the
standing rear and running ropes, at the top and
center of the load, and the hitch is ready to
tighten.</p>

<p>To tighten the hitch, grasp the running rope
a little above the cinch hook, and pull with all
your strength, taking up every inch of slack
possible. Retain this slack by holding the
standing and running rope together with left
hand, while with the right hand you reach to
top of load and pull up slack where running
rope passes under standing rope. Go to off
side and draw in all slack, following the rope
around off side pack. Retaining slack, return
to near side, and still following rope and taking
up slack around front to rear of near side
pack, grasp end of rope, already engaged as
directed over and under standing rear and
running rope, pull hard, bracing a foot against
pack, and tie. Two men, one on each side of
the horse, can, of course, throw the hitch and
tighten the load much more quickly than one.
Tightening the load is just as important a feature
of packing as evenly balancing the packs.
The result of an improperly tightened load
will pretty certainly be a sore-backed horse.</p>

not the true diamond employed by government
pack trains where the aparejo is used, but it is
a diamond evolved from the crosstree hitch,
and is particularly well adapted to the crosstree
or sawbuck pack saddle, is easily formed,
and holds the load securely, which is the ultimate

<p>The single diamond hitch employed by army
packers is the ideal hitch for securing a load
upon an aparejo. This is a two-man hitch,
though an expert can throw it alone.</p>

<p>One packer takes his position on the off side
of the animal, while the other with the coiled
lash rope, cinch attached, remains on the near
side.</p>

<p>The near packer, retaining the cinch, throws
the coiled rope over the horse's haunch, to rear.
The off packer picks up end of rope, and receiving
the hook end of cinch, passed to him
under horse's belly by near packer, holds it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85" name="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a><br /><a id="Page_86" name="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
together with end of rope in his left hand, and
stands erect.</p>

<p>The near packer, taking a position at the
horse's neck, grasps the rope about six feet
from cinch, and with an upward and backward
motion, drops it between the two packs, one
slung on either side of the aparejo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87" name="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Still grasping the rope in his right hand just
forward of the packs at the top, he pulls forward
between the packs sufficient running rope
to permit him to bring his hand down to his
side. Retaining the rope in his right hand
he now reaches up with his left hand, and
with back of hand up and thumb under
grasps running rope and draws sufficient rope
forward to permit the left hand grasping the
rope to come down to his side, arm's length.</p>

<p>With the right elbow crooked the right hand,
still holding the rope, is brought up about on
a level with the chin, and the left hand, also
retaining its hold on the rope, thumb down, is
raised to hollow of the right arm, with loop of
rope between the hands lying outside the right
arm. Now by a single swinging motion with
both hands the rope in the right hand, called
the "standing rope," is thrown over the center
of pack to the off packer who stands ready
to receive it; and the rope held in the left hand,
called the "running rope," over the horse's
neck, forward of the pack.</p>

<p>The off packer, still standing with cinch hook
and end of rope in left hand, with his right
hand grasps the standing rope as it comes over
as high up as he can conveniently reach, draws
it down, and holding the cinch hook in proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88" name="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
position below the aparejo draws down the
standing rope and engages it upon the hook
from in out.</p>

<p>The near packer now draws forward between
the packs about six feet more rope, which he
throws to the rear of the near side pack. This
rope is now called the "rear" rope. He next
grasps the running rope at the horse's neck,
and with the off packer's assistance releases that
portion of the running rope lying between the
packs forward of the standing rope, and brings
it to the center of pack on near side, next to and
just back of the standing rope.</p>

<p>He now slips his right hand down the rope
to a point half way between pack and aparejo
boot, and with the left hand reaches from forward
between standing rope and aparejo and
grasps the rope just above the right hand. Both
hands are now slipped down the rope, and with
the same motion drawn apart, one on each side
of standing rope (under which the rope being
manipulated passes) to the cinches. With the
hands about ten inches apart, the section of rope
between them, which is held in a horizontal
position, is jammed down between the two
cinches under the aparejo.</p>

<p>The off packer, holding the running rope
with his right hand above the hook, places the
left hand holding end of rope on top of running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89" name="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
rope between his right hand and the hook, and
with thumb under running rope grasps both
ropes and slips his hands up on running rope,
bringing it to center of load.</p>

<p>He now draws the end of the rope, held by
left hand, forward until a foot or so falls upon
the near side of the horse's neck. The hitch
is now formed, ready to tighten.</p>

<p>To tighten, the near packer with his left
palm passing the side and center of the pack
grasps the running rope at the rear of the standing
rope, at the same time bringing the running
rope between the thumb and index finger of the
left hand, which he is using as a brace. In this
position he is prepared to hold slack as it is
given him by the off packer.</p>

<p>The off packer grasps the running rope close
down to the hook, and, bracing himself with a
knee against the aparejo boot, pulls with all his
might, taking two or more pulls, if necessary,
and giving slack to near packer, until no more
slack can be taken on standing rope. He now
steps smartly to rear and throws the top rope
forward of the pack. The top rope is the rope
leading up from the rear corner of the aparejo
boot on near side to the side and center of off
side pack. After it is thrown forward it is
called the "front" rope. He now prepares to
receive slack from near packer by grasping the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90" name="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
rear rope where it lies between the packs.</p>

<p>The near packer, who has been receiving the
slack given him by the off packer, carries his
right hand, with which he holds the slack at
rear of standing rope, to lower side of pack
toward the aparejo, and reaches under standing
rope, with left hand grasps rope above right
hand, drawing it forward under standing rope,
and employing both hands jams it upward in a
bight between standing rope and pack. Care
should be taken during this operation to retain
all slack.</p>

<p>The near packer now engages around front
boot of aparejo the free portion of the running
rope below the bight just formed. Holding
slack with left hand, he grasps the rope to rear
of cinch in right hand; receiving slack from left
hand he brings rope to rear of aparejo boot,
and with both hands carries rope smartly to
upper corner of side pack, always retaining
slack. The off packer receives slack, pulling it
in quickly hand over hand, the near packer retaining
his hold until the off packer has the rope
taut. The near packer now takes a position
at the forward end of load, facing the rear, and
grasps end of rope prepared to take slack from
off packer.</p>

<p>The off packer, after receiving slack from
near packer as described takes a turn of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91" name="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
rope around each hand, holding every inch of
slack, steps to the rear, keeping in line with
the horse's body, and then facing forward
throws his full weight back upon the rope. Retaining
the slack with his left hand, with his
right hand he brings the free portion of running
rope under and around the aparejo boot,
from rear to front, passes forward of rope, and
facing the rear and grasping rope, right hand
above the left, brings it smartly to upper corner
of pack.</p>

<p>The near packer, holding end of rope, immediately
draws in slack until he has about six
feet of free rope, which he throws over center
of load to off side, and then drawing in all remaining
slack takes a turn of rope around each
hand and throws his weight upon it, and the off
packer releases his hold.</p>

<p>Holding the slack with the left hand, the
near packer releases his right hand and with
it engages the free or running portion of rope
under and around the aparejo boot to rear
of load, while the off packer steps to rear of
load, takes end of rope, and while he draws
in all slack, neatly coils rope, holding coil in
right hand at lower side of pack, and, with palm
of left hand braced against center of load, receives
slack from near packer.</p>

<p>Grasping in his left hand the taut rope above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92" name="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the coils, and lifting it sufficiently above the
load to admit the coiled rope under it, he swings
the coils with his right hand from rear to front
to top of load and brings the standing rope
held in his left hand down on top of the coils
to hold them. He now takes a loop of the
rope, forces it between standing rope and pack,
in a bight, and takes a turn of the loop around
standing and running rope to secure it, first
joining the loop well up, and the hitch is tightened.</p>

<h3>THE ONE-MAN OR LIFTING HITCH</h3>

<p>This is a pretty good hitch sometimes where
kyacks are not used and an irregular pack is
swung upon the crosstree. While it holds the
pack very securely to the animal's back, its
tendency is to lift the corners that might cause
friction upon the horse's sides.</p>

<p>Standing on the near side of the horse, throw
cinch over the horse's back, pick up cinch and
engage rope upon cinch hook, from in out, as
in previous hitches. Take up slack, bring running
rope up side of pack, double and thrust
loop or bight under standing rope from rear
forward at top of pack, to hold slack. Throw
all loose rope to off side, and pass around to
off side yourself.</p>

<p>Draw loose end of running rope forward and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94" name="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
from under standing rope at top of pack. The
effect of operations thus far is this: The running
rope passes up the near side, from hook
and to top of load and passes under standing
rope, which will serve effectually in final tightening
of cinch to hold slack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95" name="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Pass end of running rope over and under
the forward end of off pack and backward under
standing rope and pack. Now bring the
rope forward over side of pack, double, and
thrust the doubled portion over and under forward
rope in a bight. With left hand grasp
double of rope at bight just to rear of forward
rope where it passes over and under forward
rope, and with right hand slip running rope
down and just to rear of standing rope. Take
up slack. By pulling hard upon loose end of
running rope the ends of pack will be lifted
slightly.</p>

<p>Throw loose end over horse to near side,
and across middle of load. Pass to near side
and manipulate rope as on off side. Tighten
load. Secure the hitch by bringing loose end
of rope over and under forward running and
standing ropes, and tie.</p>

<h3>STIRRUP HITCH</h3>

<p>This hitch is useful where the packer has
lash rope but no cinch, and may be employed on
sawbuck saddle, aparejo, or where the load is
hung upon an ordinary riding saddle. It is a
two-man hitch, though one man may manipulate
it.</p>

    <div class="caption">
        <p>
            (<span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>) Rope is thrown across load with equal portion
            falling on each side. Loop A is formed on top of
            load, and the ends BB are passed through it to form
            large loops C and D.
        </p>
    </div>

        </p>
        <p>
            (<span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>) Loops C and D are passed under horse's
            belly and seized by packers on opposite sides. Each packer
            then draws end of rope which he is holding through loop
            which has been passed to him. Off packer forms bowline
            knot, E, and near packer passes his end of rope through
            this. Hitch is now ready to tighten.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Pass the rope over the load, with an equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96" name="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a><br /><a id="Page_97" name="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
division of rope on either side. Form a loop
at center and top of load. Each packer will
now place a foot upon the rope, where it falls
from loop to ground, and pass his end of rope
through loop from above down and draw
through slack rope. This forms a loop on
either side in which the foot rests. Each
packer will now bring forward and under the
horse's belly the loop in which his foot rests,
passing the loop to the other packer at the same
time disengaging his foot, and will pass the
loose end of rope which he holds through the
loop which he receives. The ropes on top of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98" name="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
pack will now be spread to properly cover and
secure the pack, and all slack taken.</p>

<p>The off side packer now forms a bowline
knot in the loose end of his rope, the near side
packer passes his loose end through the bowline
loop. To tighten the load the off side
packer gives slack, while the near side packer
braces and draws in on loose end of rope, tying
at bowline loop to secure load.</p>

<h3>THE SADDLE HITCH</h3>

            With rope arranged as shown throw deer across saddle,
            enlarge loops A and B around haunches and neck. Bring
            ends C and D together, form bowline knot on end D, pass
            end C through it and tighten.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This is a particularly useful hitch when it
becomes necessary to sling a deer to a riding
saddle for transportation to camp.</p>

<p>Throw the lash rope across the saddle seat,
an equal division of rope falling to either side.
Double the rope where it crosses the cinch ring
and thrust it through the cinch ring in a loop,
drawing through enough loose rope to form a
good-sized loop. This should be done on both
sides. Lay the deer across saddle, with head
hanging on one side and haunches on the other
side, slip loop on one side over the deer's head,
and the loop on the other side over its
haunches. Take in all slack. Form a bowline
loop on end of off side rope, and lay it on
top of load. This loop should be so adjusted
as to reach the middle of the top of load.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99" name="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Passing to near side, thread loose end of near
side rope through the bowline loop. Tighten
load by pulling on loose end, and tie.</p>

<h3>HOW TO PACK A SICK OR INJURED MAN</h3>

<p>Sometimes it occurs that a member of a party
is so injured or becomes so ill as to be helpless,
and the problem of transporting him upon
horseback presents itself. This may be done
in the following manner upon a crosstree or
sawbuck saddle:</p>

<p>Cut two straight sticks three feet long and
about three inches in diameter. Fit one on
either side of saddle snug against the forks.
Lash securely to forks forward and rear, with
ends of sticks protruding an equal distance forward
of and back of forward and rear forks.
It may be well to cut shallow notches in the
sticks where they rest against the forks. This
will preclude lateral motion.</p>

<p>Cut two sticks two feet long and three inches
in diameter. Place one in front and one in
rear at right angles to and across top of sticks
already in position. These cross-pieces are to
be lashed to position one about two inches
from forward ends, the other two inches from
rear ends of lengthwise sticks. Before lashing
them into position cut notches to receive lash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100" name="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
ropes at points of intersection, that any tendency
to slip or work loose may be overcome.</p>

<p>Now cut two poles six feet long and three
inches in diameter. Spread a pack cloth upon
the ground, and presuming the pack cloth is
six feet wide, place a pole on each outer end
of it. Roll poles, with pack cloth, to center
until there is a width of twenty inches between
the outer edges of poles. In this position lace
cloth to each pole, or if horseshoe or other
nails are handy, nail it to poles. Should the
cloth be wider than length of poles, fold in a
margin on each end, before rolling. Place litter
on cross-pieces, the flat of canvas on top.
Notch, and secure poles of stretcher at front
and rear to cross-pieces. Lash down litter by
means of the stirrup hitch.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII" name="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br /><br />
TRAVELING WITHOUT A PACK HORSE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">The</span> man who travels without a pack
horse, and carries his full equipment
and provision supply upon his saddle
must, of necessity, deny himself many things
that under ordinary circumstances are deemed
essentials. He must indeed travel light, and
unless he is well inured to roughing it will be
content to confine his activities to the warmer
and less inclement months.</p>

<p>The food supply is the first consideration,
but nowadays one is certain to come every three
or four days at the outside upon some point
where fresh supplies may be purchased. Therefore,
twelve to fifteen pounds of provisions,
carefully selected from the ration already suggested,
will meet the utmost needs. In selecting
the ration it is well to eliminate all luxuries.
It may also be said that canned goods are too
heavy, where one is to pack more than a two-days'
supply, and bacon should be made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102" name="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
basis of the meat diet. But then we are considering
methods of packing and carrying,
rather than check lists. Limiting the quantity
to fifteen pounds for a five-days' trip&mdash;and this
is ample with judicious selection&mdash;the individual
will be left to decide his ration for himself.</p>

<p>Saddle bags will be found indispensable and
in them will be ample room to carry the limited
toilet articles required, a hand towel, one
change of light woolen or summer underwear,
matches, tobacco and rifle cartridges. The
best shelter is a lean-to tent, made of extra
light cloth. This should be about seven feet
long, four and one-half feet high and four feet
deep. Such a tent will weigh about three
pounds.</p>

<p>The cooking outfit will be limited to essentials.
If it can be had an aluminum army or
"Preston" mess kit, either of which weighs
about two pounds, a sheath knife with broad
blade, and a pint cup, will fill all requirements.
If the mess kit cannot be procured, a small
frying pan with folding handle, an aluminum
or enamel plate and a dessert spoon with sheath
knife, and a pint cup, will do nearly as well.
In this latter case coffee may be made in the cup.
A small canteen, which may be hung upon the
saddle horn, should also be provided.</p>

<p>A small belt axe that weighs about two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103" name="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pounds, with sheath, a lariat and a few feet
of rope will be required.</p>

<p>A single blanket or a pair of light blankets
not exceeding five pounds in weight will constitute
the only bedding that can be conveniently
carried.</p>

<p>To pack the outfit spread tent flat upon the
ground, turning the triangular ends in to lie
flat. Fold the tent once, end for end. This
will make a rectangular pack cloth three and
one-half feet long and about five and one-half
feet wide. Fold your blanket to a size a little
smaller than tent and spread it flat upon the
tent. Arrange your provision packages on the
blanket a foot or so from one end and with a
margin of a foot or more on either side. Fold
the end of blanket and tent up and over the
packages and roll up blanket and tent together
with a band close to the knob in center to hold
the packages in place and prevent their working
down toward ends of roll.</p>

<p>The provisions should be thoroughly protected
in bags, as previously suggested, in order
that they may not soil the blanket.</p>

<p>Place the roll directly behind saddle seat
with the bulge caused by the provision bulk
resting against saddle seat, the end of roll falling
on either side, and tie in position by means
of leather tie strings attached to saddle on each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104" name="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
side. The tie should be made in both cases
just below the bulge in roll.</p>

<p>The tent will protect blanket and provisions,
and if judgment has been used in the selection
and arrangement of provisions the bulk should
not be unduly or inconveniently large. The
cooking kit, if enclosed in a canvas case with
handle, may be lashed to roll by passing lash
string through the handle and over the top
and around the kit. A strap above the upper
loop of the rifle boot and through the belt
loop on the axe scabbard will hold the axe and
another buckled around the rifle boot and lower
end of handle will prevent a slapping motion
of the handle.</p>

<p>The poncho, neatly rolled, may be carried
on the pommel, the center of the roll pressed
against the back of the horn, the ends drawn
down and forward of the pommel on either
side and secured with the leathern tie strings
attached to the saddle. When not in use
sweater or Pontiac shirt may be carried with
the poncho.</p>

<p>The horse may be picketed with the lariat.
Hobbles may be made as cowboys make them
from rope. A strand unraveled from half-inch
rope brought once around one leg, twisted
rather tightly, the ends brought around the
other leg and secured in the twist between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
legs, makes a good hobble. Always fasten
picket rope or hobble below the fetlock just
above the hoof&mdash;<i>never</i> above the fetlock.</p>

<p>The outfit here outlined will weigh, including
rifle and a reasonable amount of ammunition,
from forty to forty-five pounds at the
utmost, and one may be very comfortable with
it. If game and fish can be caught and are
to be depended upon, the provisions may be
cut down to a little flour, bacon, coffee and
sugar, and the traveler may tarry in the wilderness
for a considerable time.</p>

<p>One may leave out the tent, and in a warm
climate even the blanket, relying for shelter
wholly upon the poncho. An experienced man
will often limit his cooking outfit to a cup and
canteen. A good strong reliable horse, a good
saddle equipment, and enough plain food is all
one really needs who has experience in wilderness
travel. Such a man can make himself
comfortable with exceedingly little.</p>

AFOOT IN SUMMER</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">On</span> the portage one may carry a pretty
heavy pack and think nothing of it, for
the end of the portage and the relaxation
of the paddle is just ahead. The portage
is merely an incident of the canoe trip.</p>

<p>The foot traveler, however, has no canoe
to carry him and his outfit five or ten miles for
every mile he carries his outfit. He must carry
both himself and his outfit the entire distance
traversed. This is obvious, and it leads to the
conclusion that the outfit must be accordingly
reduced both in weight and bulk.</p>

<p>How heavy a load may be easily transported
depends, of course, upon the man, but it is safe
to say that the inexperienced will find twenty-five
pounds a heavy enough burden, and within
this limit must be included shelter, bed, and
one week's provisions; though ordinarily the
tramper will be able to renew his supply of
provisions almost daily.</p>

<p>Under all ordinary circumstances a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107" name="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
woolen blanket weighing not to exceed three
pounds will be found ample summer bedding.
A lean-to shelter tent seven feet long, four feet
wide and four feet high of one of the light
tenting materials previously described, weighs
less than three pounds and furnishes ample and
comfortable shelter. Blanket and tent may be
carried easily in a roll, the tent on the outside
to protect the blanket.</p>

<p>To make the roll spread the tent upon the
ground, fold the blanket once, end for end, and
spread it upon the tent, the sides of the blanket
(<i>not</i> folded ends) toward the ends of the
tent. Fold in ends of tent over blanket and
roll up. Double the roll and tie together a
little above the ends with a stout string. The
roll, dropped over the head with center resting
upon one shoulder and the tied ends coming
together near the hip on the opposite side, may
be carried with little inconvenience. Blankets
are usually seventy-two inches wide, therefore
the roll should be about six feet in length before
it is doubled and the ends tied.</p>

<p>A belt axe will be carried, in a sheath, upon
the belt, the remaining equipment and provisions
in a Nessmuk pack or a ruck sack. The
Nessmuk pack, sold by most outfitters, is about
<span class="dimension">12 &times; 20 &times; 5</span> inches in size and made of waterproofed
canvas. This will easily hold a nine-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108" name="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>inch
frying pan with folding handle, an aluminum
pan <span class="dimension">7 &times; 3</span> inches with folding handle, a
pint cup (if you do not wish to carry the cup
on your belt), a spoon or two, a cooking knife,
a dish cloth and a dish towel, together with one
week's provisions, matches, etc. There will
still be room for a small bag containing the few
needed toilet articles and hand towel, and another
small bag containing one change of light-weight
woolen underwear and two pairs of
socks.</p>

<p>The cooking outfit indicated is limited, but
quite ample. I have done very well for weeks
at a time with no other cooking utensils than
a pint cup and a sheath knife. But here we
cannot go into woodcraft or extreme concentration
of rations and outfit. We are considering,
rather, comfortable or moderately comfortable
outfits and how to pack or transport
them.</p>

<p>Tent, blanket, axe, food and other equipment
above suggested will, if intelligently selected,
not go beyond the twenty-five pound
limit. The greatest weight will be in the food,
and each day will reduce this about two pounds.
If provisions can be purchased from day to day
these, of course, need not be carried, and the
remaining load will be very light indeed.</p>

<p>I would suggest that a light sweater take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109" name="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
place of a coat as it will be found more comfortable
and useful and may be carried on top
of the pack or in the blanket roll, for it will
rarely be worn save in the evening camp.</p>

<p>A broad-brimmed felt hat, an outer shirt of
medium-weight flannel, khaki trousers and
strong but not too heavy shoes make a practical
and comfortable costume. Woolen socks
protect the feet from chafing. Some campers
like long German stockings, which serve also
for leggings, and wear thin cotton socks inside
them. In selecting shoes take into consideration
the kind of socks or stockings to be worn,
and see that the shoes are amply large though
not too large, for shoes too large are nearly
as uncomfortable as shoes too small.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV" name="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br /><br />
WITH SNOWSHOES AND TOBOGGAN</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">In</span> the mode of travel here to be considered
the voyageur, equipped with snowshoes,
hauls his provisions and entire camping
paraphernalia upon a toboggan or flat sled.
The toboggan (Indian ta&acute;-bas-kan&acute;) had its origin
in the prehistoric past among the Algonquin
Indians of northeastern America. It was designed
by them for the purpose of transporting
goods over trackless, unbeaten snow wastes
where sleds with runners could not be used, and
for this purpose it is unequaled.</p>

<p>While for our purpose the conventionalized
toboggan sold by outfitters and designed for
hill sliding and general sport will answer very
well, the wilderness model in use by Indians
and trappers in our northern wilderness is a
better designed and preferable type for the
transportation of loads.</p>

<p>Various lengths of toboggans are in use,
each intended for the particular purpose for
which it was built. The longest Indian tobog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111" name="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>gan
I ever saw was twelve feet in length, but
from six to eight feet is the ordinary length,
with a width of nine inches at the tip of the
curved nose, gradually increasing to fourteen
inches wide where the curve ends and the sliding
surface or bottom begins, and tapering away
to about six inches wide at the heel. The conventionalized
type averages from four to six
feet in length with a uniform width of about
fifteen inches from curve to heel.</p>

<p>Some three or more crossbars, depending
upon the length of the toboggan, are lashed at
intervals across the top, the forward one at
the beginning of the curve where the nose begins
to turn upward, and on either side of the
toboggan from front to rear side bar, and
fastened to the side bars at their ends are side
ropes.</p>

<p>Beaver-tail, bear's-paw, or swallow-tail
snowshoes, of Indian make, are the shapes best
adapted to the sort of travel we are considering.
These models are all broad and comparatively
short. The web should be of good
caribou babiche, closely woven for use upon
dry snow, and indeed for all-around conditions.
While on wet, soggy snow a coarse web may in
some respects be preferable it will not compare
in efficiency with the close web on loose
snow, or for all-around work under all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112" name="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of conditions. Long, narrow snowshoes may
be very good for racing where the country is
smooth, but they are not suited to a rough,
wooded or broken country or to hummocky
snow.</p>

<p>The best and most practical, as well as the
simplest sling or binding for the snowshoe is
made as follows: Cut from an Indian tanned
buckskin a thong about half an inch wide and
thirty inches in length. Thread one end of
this, from above down, through the web at one
side of the toe hole, and from the bottom up
at the opposite side. Pull it through until the
two ends are even. Draw the thong up at the
middle, where it crosses the toe hole, to make
a loop large enough to admit the toe under it,
but not large enough to permit the toe to slide
forward against the forward cross-bar. Wrap
the two ends of the thong around center of
loop two or three times bringing them forward
over the top and drawing them under and back
through the loop. Slip your toes under the
loop, bring the ends of the thong back, one
on either side of the foot, and tie snugly in
the hollow above your heel.</p>

<p>This sling will hold well, will not chafe the
foot, and with it the snowshoe may be kicked
free from the foot or adjusted to the foot in an
instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113" name="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Should the thongs stretch in moist weather,
the sling may be tightened by simply taking an
additional turn or two (without untying)
around the toe loop.</p>

<p>I believe that lamp-wicking would answer as
well as buckskin thongs, though I have never
used it because I have always carried an ample
supply of buckskin.</p>

<p>The best underclothing for the winter trail
is good weight&mdash;though not the heaviest&mdash;woolen.
Two suits should be carried besides
the suit worn. Underclothing should not fit the
body too snugly. It is better that it should be
a size too large than an exact fit.</p>

<p>The outer shirt should be of flannel, and of
good quality, though not too heavy.</p>

<p>Hudson's Bay Company trappers wear
good-weight moleskin trousers, almost entirely
to the exclusion of other fabrics, and I adopted
them several years ago as superior to any
other. They are wind-proof and warm and
are particularly well adapted to the rough
work of the trail.</p>

<p>The ordinary coat is not at all adapted to
the northern wilderness in winter, for it will not
protect against drifting snow and driving blizzard.
In its stead the Eskimo adickey should
be worn.</p>

<p>Any seamstress who can cut and make an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ordinary work shirt can make an adickey if
your outfitter cannot supply it. This garment
is slipped on over the head like a shirt, and
has a hood attached to draw over the cap as a
neck and head protection. The neck opening
is large enough to permit the head to pass
through it without the necessity of a buttoned
opening in front, for no matter how closely
buttoned a garment may be drifting snow will
find its way in. In length the adickey reaches
half way between hip and knees and is made
circular at the bottom. The hood should be
of ample proportion to pull over the cap
loosely, with a drawstring encircling the front
by which it may be drawn snugly to the face.
A fringe of muskrat or other fur around the
face increases the comfort, the fur acting as a
protection against drifting snow. While white
Hudson's Bay Company kersey cloth is a favorite
fabric for this garment, it may be made of
any woolen blanket duffle or similar cloth.</p>

<p>Over the kersey adickey another adickey of
some smooth-surfaced, strong material, preferably
moleskin, should be worn. This outside
adickey should of course be just enough larger
than the kersey or blanket adickey to fit over
it easily. The adickeys may be worn singly
or together, according to the demands of the
weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115" name="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>A Pontiac shirt, to be worn under the adickeys
in extremely cold weather, should be included
in the outfit. This will serve, too, in
camp, when the adickeys are laid aside.</p>

<p>A round cap of fur or heavy cloth provided
with flaps to turn down over the ears makes
the best head protection. The hoods of the
two adickeys, as before stated, should be large
enough to draw over this.</p>

<p>Very important indeed is the question of foot
dress. Not only must we aim to secure the
greatest possible freedom and ease in walking,
but the ever-present danger of frostbite must
also be guarded against.</p>

<p>Socks should be of wool, of the home-knit
variety, and besides the pair worn, three or
four extra pairs should be carried in the kit.</p>

<p>Knit socks will not be sufficient protection,
however, and where two or three pairs are
worn they are certain to bunch or wrinkle, with
chafed and sore feet as a result. All Hudson's
Bay Company stores keep in stock a
white fuzzy woolen duffle of blanket thickness.
If you are making your start from a Post purchase
some of this duffle and have one of the
women at the Post make you a pair of knee-length
stockings of the duffle to pull over your
knit socks, and two pairs of slippers of the
same material, one just large enough to fit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116" name="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
over the foot of the long stockings, the other
just a little larger to fit over all. These should
be made of proper size, to obviate wrinkles.
The larger outfitters carry in stock good wool
duffle, and will make these to fit properly.</p>

<p>In crisp, cold weather, when the snow never
softens or gets moist even under the midday
sun, buckskin moccasins should be the outer
footwear. Ordinary leather will freeze stiff,
stop the proper circulation of blood, and
certainly lead to frosted feet. The moccasins
should be made with high tops, reaching above
the ankles, with buckskin strings to wrap
around and secure them. Moccasins are light
to pack, and it is always well to carry a couple
of extra pairs, to have on hand in case of
emergency.</p>

<p>Leggings of moleskin (or some other strong,
pliable cloth) large enough to push the foot
through protect the legs. These should be
knee high, with a drawstring to secure them
just below the knee. Ordinary canvas leggings
will not do. The leggings <i>must</i> be made in
one piece, without side buttons or other fastenings,
for otherwise snow will work through to
the great discomfort of the wearer.</p>

<p>I have a pair of buckskin moccasins sewn to
legs of harbor sealskin, the hair side of the
sealskin out. This arrangement is preferable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to separate leggings but sealskin legs are difficult
to procure.</p>

<p>Ordinarily I have found one pair of knit
socks, one pair of the long duffle stockings described
above and one pair of the duffle slippers,
worn inside the buckskin moccasins, quite sufficient.</p>

<p>The knit socks may be done away with entirely
and also one pair of duffle slippers if
rabbit-skin socks are to be had. These are
worn with the hair next the foot, and are very
warm and soft.</p>

<p>In weather when the snow softens and becomes
wet at midday, buckskin moccasins will
not do, for the least moisture penetrates buckskin.
In such weather sealskin boots are the
best foot protection. They are waterproof,
pliable and light. Sealskin boots for this purpose
have neither soles nor heels. They are
simply sealskin moccasins with legs, secured
with drawstrings below the knee. These are
of Eskimo make, and not generally obtainable
though they may be purchased in Newfoundland.
Oil-tanned moccasins, or larrigans, are
the next best moist-snow foot gear.</p>

<p>Buckskin mittens with one or two inner pairs
of mittens of thick wool duffle, will protect the
hands in the coldest weather. One pair should
be a little smaller than the other, that it may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118" name="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
fit snugly into the larger pair without wrinkles,
and the larger pair of a size to fit in the same
manner into the buckskin mittens. When the
weather is too warm for both pairs, one pair
may be removed. A fringe of muskrat or
other fur around the wrists of the buckskin
mittens protects the wrists from drifting snow.</p>

<p>A pad of rabbit-skin worn across the forehead
will protect it from intense cold. Hunting
hoods of knit camel's hair worsted are a
pretty good head protection, particularly at
night. They cover the whole head except the
face, and may be drawn up over the chin.
Mouth and nose must not be covered, or the
breath will quickly form a mass of ice upon
the face.</p>

<p>One caution, though it may seem a digression,
may be made: If the nose or cheeks become
frosted, as will certainly happen sooner
or later to one traveling in a very low temperature,
<i>do not rub snow upon the frosted part</i>.
Snow rubbed on is pretty certain to fracture
and remove sections of the skin. The Eskimo
way is to hold or rub the frosted part with
the bare hand until frost has been removed,
and is far superior.</p>

<p>The clothing outfit above described will be
found ample. Extra trousers or other extra
outer garments are not needed. <i>Let all hang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119" name="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
loosely upon the body.</i> Nothing should fit
snugly.</p>

<p>A pair of smoked or amber goggles should
always be included in the winter outfit. Amber
is more effective than smoked glass,
though ordinarily the latter will do. The goggles
should be fastened with a string to slip
over the back of the head. <i>No metal should
touch the flesh.</i></p>

<p>The best low temperature sleeping bag is
one of caribou skin made with the hair inside.
Under ordinary conditions, however, a waterproofed
canvas bag lined with good woolen
blankets will do as well, though such a bag
with sufficient blanket lining to give it warmth
equal to that of the caribou skin bag would
be much heavier and more bulky than the latter.
A bag lined with four thicknesses of
llama wool duffle (that is, four thicknesses
over and four beneath the sleeper), however,
should not weigh more than ten pounds, and
would correspond in warmth to one lined with
blankets weighing twenty pounds.</p>

<p>An A or wedge tent will be found the best
model for winter travel. A sheet-iron tent
stove <i>with bottom</i> and telescoping pipe will
make the tent warm and snug. The tent
should be fitted with an asbestos ring at the
stovepipe hole as a protection. A pack cloth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120" name="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
or tarpaulin will serve as an adequate and
comfortable tent floor.</p>

<p>It is never safe or advisable for one to travel
in the wilderness alone, for a sprained ankle
or broken leg in an isolated region would be
more than likely to result in death.</p>

<p>In the Hudson Bay country two pounds of
flour, one pound of fat pork, with baking powder,
tea and sugar, form the daily ration for a
man. It is well when possible to carry frozen
fresh meat, free from bone, with a proportion
of desiccated vegetables to vary the diet. Butter
makes a tasty variety to the fat, for it will
remain sweet at this season. Prunes and chocolate
are both worth while.</p>

<p>Or if the journey is to be extended the
menu may be simplified by the introduction
of pemmican and the elimination of other
articles. Pemmican is the best condensed
food ever invented for cold weather work.
One pound of pemmican and a quarter
pound of pilot biscuit, as a daily ration, will
sustain a man at hard work, though it will
prove a monotonous diet. The above is
merely suggested as a basis. It may be expanded
or contracted as circumstances require
without disturbing its mean value. Let it be
remembered, however, that ordinary bread
and other moist foodstuffs will freeze as hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121" name="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
as stone. Jerked venison and desiccated vegetables
make tasty and sustaining additions to
the ration, and will not freeze.</p>

<p>A man is supposed to be able to haul at good
speed upon a toboggan a load equal to his own
weight. Therefore two men, each weighing
150 pounds, should between them haul 300
pounds. Camp equipment, tent axes, guns,
bedding, extra underclothing and all personal
belongings of both, if proper care be exercised
in selection, should weigh not to exceed
140 pounds. Add 80 pounds of food, and we
have 220 pounds, or a maximum load of 110
pounds for each. The tent and general camp
outfit is indeed sufficient for four men. It is
presumed that the aluminum cooking outfit
previously described will be chosen. Some
eliminations, as, for example, that of the folding
baker, might easily be made without serious
loss of comfort.</p>

<p>To secure the load upon the toboggan, arrange
the bags in which it is packed evenly,
taking care that no part of the load extends
beyond the sides of the toboggan. Adjust the
tarpaulin or canvas ground cloth neatly over
it. Secure one end of your lash rope to the
side rope on one side at the rear. Bring the
other end over and under the side rope opposite.
Cross it back over the load and over and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122" name="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
under side rope to front of next crossbar, and
so on to front crossbar, taking slack as you
proceed. From front to rear criss-cross rope
in same manner over load and under side ropes,
forming diamonds where the rope crosses itself
on top of load. Bring the end of rope under
side rope at rear, take in all slack and tie.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV" name="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br /><br />
WITH DOGS AND KOMATIK</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="allcap">In</span> considering equipment for dog and
sledge traveling, we must constantly bear
in mind the necessity of keeping down
weight and bulk. Not long since, while visiting
the establishment of a New York City
outfitter, I saw an equipment which a sportsman
ambitious for experience with dogs and
komatik (sledge) had selected for a month's
journey which he was about to undertake. Exclusive
of provisions there was enough material
to weight down four eight-dog teams.
Among other things was a specially designed
tent stove that would have tipped the scales at
upwards of one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The would-be traveler declared with pride
that he "did not intend to have cold camps."
It certainly gave me "cold feet" to contemplate
his outfit. It was the most ridiculous
and impracticable conglomerate aggregation of
camping material that I have ever seen put to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124" name="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>gether,
and I doubt if the would-be traveler
ever found a sufficient number of dogs at any
one point to transport it.</p>

<p>While it is the aim of every experienced
camper to obtain the greatest degree of comfort
of which circumstances will admit, the
voyager with dogs cannot hope to carry with
him the luxuries of a metropolitan hotel, and
one soon learns how little after all is really
necessary to make one comfortable.</p>

<p>How much weight a team of eight good
dogs can haul depends upon the character of
the country and the condition of the snow or
ice. Under very favorable conditions I have
seen such a team make good progress with
twelve hundred pounds. Ordinarily, however,
eight hundred pounds is a full load, and if
much rough ice, hilly country or soft snow is
encountered six hundred pounds will be found
all too heavy. I have heard of cases, when
traveling was exceptionally good, of dogs covering
upwards of one hundred miles a day.
The biggest day's travel I ever made with dogs
was sixty miles, but often I have toiled day after
day, pulling and hauling with the animals at
the traces, lifting the komatik over rough
places, or packing a trail for the team with my
snowshoes, to find myself rewarded with less
than ten miles when camping time arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125" name="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>In selecting outfit the region to be visited
will be a factor to take into consideration. It
would be quite impossible to discuss adequately
in a single chapter all the phases of dog travel
to be provided for. We shall therefore leave
out of consideration polar outfitting, or outfitting
for other unusual work, which the reader
of this will scarcely be likely to undertake.</p>

<p>The clothing suggested in the chapter on
snowshoe and toboggan travel is equally well
suited to travel with dogs and komatik. Should
the voyager's ambition, however, draw him
within the sub-arctic regions or across the Arctic
Circle some additional protection will be
needed.</p>

<p>In the far Arctic the natives wear trousers
of either polar bear skin or caribou skin, with
an upper garment of caribou skin called, in
Greenland, the "kulutar;" in Labrador, the
"kulutuk." The only difference between the
adickey and the kulutuk is that the one is made
of cloth, the other of caribou skin. In Ungava
I supplied myself with caribou skin trousers,
which, as is the custom there, I drew on
over my moleskin trousers in windy or intensely
cold weather.</p>

<p>The kulutuk takes the place of the moleskin
adickey. That is to say, the kersey adickey
worn under the kulutuk will be found ample<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126" name="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
protection in any weather, and often the kulutuk
of itself will be found sufficient.</p>

<p>Kulutuk and skin trousers are worn hair side
out. Were they worn with the hairy side in,
they would accumulate moisture exuded by the
body, and the moisture would freeze, presently
transforming the hair into a mass of ice. A
friend of mine going to the Arctic for the first
time as a member of one of Peary's early
Greenland expeditions, turned his kulutuk inside
out and donned it with the hairy side next
the body. The Eskimos laughed, and resenting
their levity he assured them it was much
warmer worn in that manner than as they wore
it. "No," said one of them, "if it were warmer
worn that way the animals would wear
their fur inside." My friend quickly learned
by experience the logic of the Eskimo's argument.</p>

<p>Deerskin kulutuk and trousers are not easily
purchased, though along any coast where seals
are captured similar garments of sealskin may
be procured, which, though not equal to deerskin
garments, answer very well. The skin of
the young harbor seal (the ranger seal) is best
for the purpose, as skins of other species are
too thick and heavy. When made of sealskin
the upper garment is called a "netsek."</p>

<p>I discovered when traveling among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
that some of the Moravian missionaries of the
Labrador coast wore a buckskin suit under
their ordinary trousers and outer shirt. Such
a suit is much lighter than deerskin trousers
and kulutuk, and serves nearly as well. It is
not difficult to purchase buckskin from which
one may have such a suit made. It is wind-proof
and very light.</p>

<p>All skin garments, including moccasins,
should be sewn with animal sinew. Ordinary
thread will quickly break out and will not do.
Thread-sewn moccasins are factory-made, and
will give very little service.</p>

<p>The types of snowshoes suggested in the
chapter on snowshoe and toboggan travel are
the types also best suited to dog and komatik
work. Long snowshoes would be very much
in the way when one has to go to the traces and
haul with the dogs or lift and assist the komatik
over rough places; and this becomes the
rule rather than the exception as one goes
North.</p>

<p>Let me insist that the web should be of good
caribou babiche, and not the ordinary rawhide
used in many of the snowshoes offered for sale.
The former will not stretch when wet, while
the latter will stretch and bag so badly as to
render the snowshoe practically useless.</p>

<p>It is well to wrap the frame on either side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128" name="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
where the babiche is drawn around it, with
buckskin or sealskin. Otherwise even a slight
crust upon the snow will in time cut the babiche
strands. Wrapping the snowshoe in this manner
will at least double its life.</p>

<p>What was said in reference to tent, small
sheet-iron stove and general camp and cooking
outfit in the previous chapter will apply here,
as well as directions heretofore given for packing
in waterproof bags. In selecting the sleeping
bag, give first preference to one of deerskin.</p>

<p>In a barren region where firewood is not to
be had, it will be necessary to carry an alcohol
or kerosene burner and stock of fuel. The
former is preferable on account of the low
freezing point of alcohol. Alcohol or oil
should be secured in tin cases. It is regularly
put up in this way by dealers.</p>

<p>In such a region, too, it may be necessary to
carry snow knives with which to cut blocks of
snow for the erection of snow igloos as shelter.
These knives resemble somewhat the
machete. One cannot, however, learn to build
a snow igloo properly without long practice.
This phase of the work is merely referred to as
interesting; for anyone traveling in a country
where snow house shelter is necessary will secure
the assistance of a native, who will attend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129" name="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to proper sledge outfitting at the point of departure.</p>

<p>On regular lines of dog travel opportunities
to renew the provision supply will frequently
occur, and cabins for night shelter will be
found. Therefore the food outfit will depend
upon the country to be traversed. Where long
stretches occur between supply points, however,
fat pork, pilot bread, tea and sugar should
form the basis. The very best possible food,
however, for this work is pemmican, pilot
bread, tea and sugar. Of course a little coffee
may be carried, but it is bulky.</p>

<p>The traveler will make his selection carefully,
building around pork, pilot bread and
pemmican with other articles of food like
desiccated vegetables from which water has
been eliminated. Too much salt meat opens
the door to scurvy, unless sufficient variation
in the way of vegetables, fish, or fresh meat
is introduced. Dessicated cranberries are an
excellent preventive. A man can do good
hard work day in and day out, as already
stated, upon one pound of pemmican and a
quarter pound of pilot bread as a daily ration,
and such a ration offers no danger of scurvy.</p>

<p>Dog pemmican is the best dog food, and the
lightest, for dogs will do pretty well upon one
pound of pemmican each a day. To do well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130" name="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the animals should be given plenty of fat,
when pemmican is not available, though not a
clear fat diet, for that will make them sick.
Three-quarters of a pound of fat and three-quarters
of a pound of meat or fish is an ordinary
ration. Dogs are fed but once a day&mdash;at
night.</p>

<p>The number of dogs in a team varies, but
the average team is composed of seven or
eight. Eight or nine is the most economical
number so far as results are concerned.</p>

<p>In the Northwest dogs are harnessed tandem.
This is the white man's method. In the
Northeast they are harnessed fan fashion&mdash;the
Eskimo method. That is to say, each dog
has an individual trace secured to the end of a
single thong, leading out from the bow of the
komatik and called the bridle. The individual
traces are of various lengths. The dog with
the longest trace is the leader of the pack, and
particularly trained to respond to the driver's
directions. The other dogs will follow his
lead.</p>

<p>For open country and sea ice travel the Eskimo
method is probably best, as the work is
more evenly distributed and the driver can always
tell whether each dog is doing his share
of the work, but for narrow trails and woods
travel the tandem method is more practicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131" name="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Dogs are good, bad and indifferent. One
seldom has an opportunity to pick one's dogs
discriminately, and rarely may one purchase
them outright unless contracted for a year in
advance, for the native dog owner seldom
maintains animals in excess of his requirements
in the ordinary routine of his life. The
traveler will usually be able, however, to hire
a team by employing the owner to drive it, and
the owner of a team will get much more work
out of his dogs than a stranger to the dogs
can hope to do.</p>

<p>At least a year's experience is necessary to
enable a white man to handle a dog team with
anything approaching efficiency, and even then
one cannot hope to approach the performance
of an Eskimo. The failure to enlist Eskimos
as dog drivers has been the real cause of the
failure of many an Arctic expedition.</p>

<p>It is advised, then, that the traveler employ
at so much per day or for the trip driver and
dogs. It is an unsafe experiment to start off
with a dog team unattended by an experienced
man. The owner of the team will supply also
the necessary dog harness, his own dog whip
and general dog traveling paraphernalia, including
the komatik.</p>

<p>Sledges or komatiks vary in different localities
as to width, length and minor methods of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132" name="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
construction. The average komatik is two feet
wide and ten feet long but as stated, they vary
in different localities, a uniform width being
maintained to suit the local conditions of the
region in which they are used. For example,
wide and comparatively short komatiks are
employed in Quebec, while the Ungava komatik
is but sixteen inches wide. These latter komatiks
are usually fifteen or sixteen feet in
length, however. The runners stand ten inches
high. This is, in fact, the heaviest and most
efficient komatik I have ever seen. Each runner
is made from a single piece of timber and
is from two and one-half to three inches thick.
It is designed for the roughest possible use, and
is, I believe, better adapted to this purpose than
the Greenland komatik because more substantially
built. The latter is peculiar in that it has
upstands at the rear for guiding it.</p>

<p>Crossbars, extending an inch or so on either
side of the runners and from one to two inches
apart, are lashed into place with rawhide.
When the rawhide shrinks the komatik becomes
firm. Iron fastenings being rigid would
break too readily, particularly in intense cold,
to be reliable.</p>

<p>The traveler will do well, therefore, to purchase
if he does not hire his komatik at the
point of departure, as in so doing he will se<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133" name="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>cure
one of correct design for the region to be
traversed.</p>

<p>It is well to have a box made the width of
the komatik two or three feet long, and about
fourteen inches deep to lash upon the rear end
of the komatik in which cooking utensils and
a portion of the food supply, as well as odds
and ends, may be carried. This should be supplied
with a hinged cover, and hook or clasp
by which the cover may be securely fastened
down.</p>

<p>The best lash for securing the load in position
is one of sealskin, though ordinary hemp
rope will do. Before lashing, the tarpaulin
should be neatly folded over the top of load to
protect it.</p>

<p>One end of the lash is secured to an end of
the crossbar at the forward end of the load,
brought across the load and under the other
end, then across, skipping a couple of crossbars,
and back again skipping a couple of crossbars,
thus threading it from side to side under
the ends of every second or third crossbar to
the rear bar, where it is brought across the
load to the opposite end of this crossbar and
crisscrossed across the load again to the forward
crossbar to be tied.</p>
